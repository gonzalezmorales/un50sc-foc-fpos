Metadata of those data input are necessary.- And the "Big data" challenge: how to balance the possibilities of these data as a new source with the question of the privacy of data; how to balance the role of private companies as holders/ creators of these data with the role of National Offices as a main actor/ provider/ which can guarantees quality in statistics.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043

Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		Preparing and releasing reliable statistics of a high quality is our main task. To do this properly, it is crucial at any time to follow the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. It continues to be a main challenge to preserve the core values of official statistics under tight budgetary constraints in a dynamic environment and various contexts such as interest based negotiations processes with different stakeholders. In this sense, it is a benefit to have the FPOS as a point of reference to which the Statistical Community has agreed on.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043

Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		The UK Statistics Authority only produces approximately 60% of the Official Statistics within the UK. The remaining statistics are produced by other government departments, other public bodies, and other public facing bodies that are prescribed by legislation. This partially devolved system makes it difficult to enforce the FPOS across all producers of Official Statistics. Many bodies are part of the Government Statistical System and through a strong professional group we are able to promote the FPOS. Furthermore the UK Statistical System has the Office for Statistical Regulation, this body can investigate breaches of the Code of Practice, but it is not possible for the body to proactively oversee all the official statistics being produced in the UK.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043
Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		The emergence of many new data providers and competitors in the face of declining funding and challenging resource constraints, it makes it hard to continue to deliver the same volume and level of high quality statistics.

Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		The key challenge is applying the principles in an ever-changing environment where data is everywhere and technological change is rapid. Our customers and stakeholders have high expectations about what we should deliver and views on how to ensure that we are delivering value and are maintaining relevance. Ensuring that the value of the principles are understood is not always straightforward.					1	1					25	1.0752688172043
Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		The lack of instruments that measure the level of UNFPOS implementation in sectorial level.	1					1	5.88235294117647					1.0752688172043

Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	R01		The main challenges in implementing the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (FPOS), where the basic principles are related mainly to: Lack of effective human resources system of the partners' statistical units, ongoing internal change of the statistical units staff, weakness of the statistical capabilities of statisticians in the statistical units, weakness of the accumulation and exchange of experience among the partners' staff and this is due to turnover and new appointments, no commitment in using the approved concepts and terminology, as well as the differences in the use of classifications by partners' statistical units. Challenges that have to do with the ability to embed FPOS in the statistical law in explicit manner. Changes to statistical law that need to undergo very lengthy process. Experience has shown that the practice on the ground is what really matters when it comes to exercising FPOS regardless of the type (explicit or implicit reference to FPOS) or strengths of related legislations. Despite the existence of the law that there is still ineffective to force institutions to reach the official statistical number using all the classifications, concepts and terminology used at PCBS and ensure their unification. The ineffectiveness of the law to force the data-producing institutions to provide it to PCBS Absence of a law that guarantees accessing information by PCBS			1			1			4.16666666666667			1.0752688172043
