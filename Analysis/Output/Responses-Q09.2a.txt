The derived topics not included in the regulation were omitted mainly due to: lack of interest in data by domestic users (ex. Bedrooms-number of, Lighting and / or electricity-type of), lack of comparability with the Census round 2001. Simultaneously, Poland participated in works on Recommendations for the 2010 and 2020 Censuses of Population and Housing managed by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
