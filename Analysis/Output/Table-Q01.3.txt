Q01.3	How did the NSS decide on statistical plans and budget allocations in the past five years? Who was consulted and who approved the plan?	R01		The majority of funding for official statistics in Australia is provided through annual government appropriation or through user funding of specific statistical collections. There is also an annual government budgeting process through which agencies may seek additional funding for specific initiatives or to respond to cost pressures. Governments must balance the extent to which statistical authorities are funded with other competing priorities. To deliver the best value while working within these resources, each statistical authority in the national statistical service must manage and prioritise statistical production. In real terms the funding of the ABS has reduced substantially in recent years and this trend is set to continue. ABS is working with government funding agencies and key users to retain a workable and stable financial situation, so that it can continue to deliver the official statistics Australia needs to the high levels of quality expected. The adequacy of resources is regularly monitored by statistical authorities in order to effectively manage and prioritise the statistical work program and leverage the regular government budget processes. The ABS Resource Prioritisation and Finance Committee and associated Working Group, for example, meet at least quarterly, or as frequently as weekly when required, to oversee and monitor allocations and expenditure to ensure rigour, discipline and transparency. The Committee comprises senior staff including the ABS Chief Financial Officer. There are a number of strategies that enable the production of official statistics within available resources. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has: 1. focused on achieving efficiencies by reducing corporate overheads, including reducing property costs through activity based working; 2. increased the use of administrative and transactional data collected by other entities in order to reduce direct costs to collect information from households and businesses; and 3. prioritised statistical activities and ceased some activities. The ABS classifies its statistical work program in four tiers, which are used to assist with prioritisation undertaken by the ABS. The tiers were informed by the development of the list of Essential Statistical Assets for Australia. The Essential Statistical Assets (ESA) for Australia initiative highlights statistics which are critical to decision making in Australia. The initiative contributes to effective prioritisation of investment by governments to improve the overall quality of Australia's official statistical assets, enhance their utilisation and allow for more effective integration to increase the value of the National Statistical System. The ESA was developed in consultation with the community as well as users and producers of statistics in Australia	1	1

For example, when the Department of Commerce (DOC) receives budget for the FY, they decide how to allocate it amongst DOC agencies-- Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, NOAA, NIST, etc. Allocations are based on fiscal year projects that are indicated in the agency's strategic plan. During a decennial census, it would make sense that the Census Bureau budget increases substantially, then, drop after it is over.	1	1
