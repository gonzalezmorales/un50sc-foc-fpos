Q09.3a	Details on use of the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)	220	9	Oceania	53	Australia and New Zealand			Australia	36	AUS				Developed	On the 20th November 2018, the Minister for Women the Honourable Kelly O'Dwyer MP, announced the Women's Economic Security Statement. As part of this package the Australian Bureau of Statistics will reinstate the Time Use Survey (TUS). The ABS will receive $10.4 million to develop and conduct the survey, last run in 2006. These funds include the design, development and implementation of an electronic diary (in addition to a paper diary). The initial survey will be conducted in 2020-21 followed by a smaller ongoing annual survey that will build up the evidence base over time.As the development and consultation around this survey is still in the early stages, we cannot state definitively whether it will implement ICATUS 2016

The classification was developed based on recommendations for harmonizing European time use surveys of the European Commission. The activities are classified in three levels (groups, subgroups, types). For this, the sequential coding method was applied, the code length was three numeric decimal digits. Groups are consistently detailed into subgroups and activities.

Since Germany is integrated into the European Statistical System, the national classification of activities is based on the "Activity Coding List (ACL)" of the Harmomized European Time Use Survey (HETUS). According to Eurostat, the ACL of the next HETUS data round 2020 will not be replaced by ICATUS 2016; Nor will it build on the structure of ICATUS 2016. It is possible, however, that individual key components of the ICATUS 2016 will be included in the ACL of HETUS 2020. As part of the revised HETUS Guidelines 2018, the ACL of HETUS 2020 is expected to be adopted by the end of February 2019.

Q09.3a	Details on use of the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)	165	142	Asia	145	Western Asia			Turkey	792	TUR				Developing	Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) is a member of the Time Use Survey Working Group held by Eurostat and the participation has been provided to the meetings since 2013. Accordingly, TurkStat implemented Time Use Survey (TUS) for the first time in 2006 in harmony with Harmonised European Time Use Survey (HETUS) 2002 Guideline. The second application was implemented on 1 August 2014 - 31 July 2015 by using HETUS 2008 Guideline as a reference document. TUS, 2014-2015 micro data and metadata file set was prepared and transferred by TurkStat to Eurostat HETUS Database 2010 for the first time. Consequently, activity coding list and location of activity coding list recommended in HETUS guideline were used as classification of activity in TurkStat. There are some differences between ICATUS and HETUS activity list. It can be understood that it's reason is for classifying the activities based on the concept of productive/non-productive activities following the System of National Accounts (SNA) framework in ICATUS 2016. It can be seen that the activities were grouped by taking reference of their aims and intentions in ICATUS 2016. This methodology seems logical and beneficial. In the future this subject will be more important, so more countries may use this activity list.
