Q01.8	Aditional comments on challenges to the implementation of Principle 1	R01		Equal access must be treated with cautions. There is a risk involved in granting full access to the full data set especially in small population like the Pacific islands where people or groups of people can easily be identified.There is also a risk of anti-government analysis and this will surely impact on the lives of the employees of the NSOs.We all have good intentions of releasing public information but we need to do a lot of extra work to ensure that data will not raise any political unrest in the country and the that the lives of the employees and their families will not be jeopardized. Most importantly, we do not want the free access interest to ruin the current participation rate of the community in data collections when people and groups of people will be exposed through analysis. This means we might enjoy free access on one hand at losing the trust of people to provide confidential information for anyone to comment on. The latter is the worst option for NSOs.	1	1

The results of the studies are permitted to be taken outside the Institute after the completion of controlling processes by the related experts of Turkstat. The second facility to allow user microdata is distribution on cd-rom or any other device for the Group B microdata, data in which individual data is hidden, and has no restriction for dissemination. In context of relevance, in Turkstat, procedures are in place to consult users about the statistical needs which the tools are User Evaluation Report and User Survey. User Evaluation Report Dissemination policy of the institution is to meet user requests for timely and quality, to improve awareness of using statistics. Aims for the future targets of the institution is to meet national needs for data produced as well as ensuring compliance with international standards and methodologies. Therefore, after the reference year, â€œUser Evaluation Reportâ€œ is being prepared for determining expectations, needs and the profile of the users and to have decision about production and dissemination policies by analyzing information requests. In the process of replying information requests, all requests are recorded by "Dissemination Management Systemâ€ in detail. Information requests received by Regional Offices are also obtained and recorded as to provide data integrity. By using these data, helping to guide the activities of production and distribution policies of the institution, to lead managers to plan and program and inform for deciding targets, User Evaluation Report is published for internal use. User Survey TurkStat has a user survey on its website for determining profiles, needs and expectations of users and setting the policies of the Institution in the medium and long term. It is analyzed annually and the report of the survey is shared with the staff via intranet. Structure and questions of the survey were changed in 2013 and questions appear under four main parts which are general information, using status of TurkStat data, perception and trust, and evaluation.	1	1
