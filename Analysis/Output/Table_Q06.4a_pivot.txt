In particular, the regulation allows exchanges of information to the extent that the purpose is oriented towards the production or improvement of official statistical information in Colombia. The body which decides on whether or not performing these exchanges is the National Advisory Council for Statistics (CANE), which is made up of 11 members of the public, private and academic sectors, at the national and regional levels. The requests can be made by any member of the SEN, establishing the official statistics that will be improved or the information gap that it intends to meet by means of the production of new official statistics. Based on the request as well as the justification on the development and the statistical impact that the use of the microdata will generate in Colombia, the Council conducts a voting process with absolutely majority criteria thereof all member attending the meeting, must agree upon the exchange process. Once the decision is issued, the NSS entity which is responsible for the information relating to the exchange is obliged to comply with it. To date, three exchanges with respect to information of non-anonymised microdata have been carried out between the Central Bank of Colombia and DANE. These exchanges were associated with the improvement in the production of official statistics in the services industry and international trade.
