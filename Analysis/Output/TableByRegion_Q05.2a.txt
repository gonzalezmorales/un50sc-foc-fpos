Q05.2a	Details on new technologies or methodologies used to ensure timely release of survey results and/or statistical publications/bulletins	R01		As of 2015 and starting from the creation of an internal working group on innovation, DANE has implemented a Smart Data strategy with the objective of strengthening the process of production, generation and dissemination of official statistics by incorporating alternative sources of information and non-traditional methods, such as administrative records and Big Data in the framework of the National Statistical System. The strategy is based on the implementation of pilot projects that in their majority integrate or complement traditional information from administrative records, censuses and surveys with non-traditional sources such as Earth observation data, detailed mobile phone records, social networks, and information from web pages of enterprises, among others. Once the piloting or exploration phase has been completed, and, according to the viability of the results, the incorporation process begins, which involves reviewing the aspects related to the technological infrastructure required for the incorporation, the verification of compliance with quality standards and attributes as well as the generation of necessary skills in human resources. Also, as a result of this strategy, DANE has made progress in incorporating innovations in the information collection process by making use of new technologies. A specific case is the first electronic census (eCensus) conducted in Colombia, which in addition to providing an easy, fast and secure questionnaire, also had mechanisms for verifying the identity of the persons, for the purpose of ensuring the quality and truthfulness of the information reported, through the consultation in real time of the National Registry web service. In order to ensure the georeferencing of these units, DANE integrated information from administrative records and geocoding services; as a result, the georeferencing of 97% of the registered units was achieved. DANE has also explored the use of mobile telephony data and its applications in statistical production, in such a way that within the framework of the project "Measuring the information society" -that had the participation of DANE, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and the International Telecommunications Union-, in 2017, it was possible to have access to information of detailed records of mobile phones, guarded by private companies. The access to this type of source continues however to be one of the main challenges to overcome. Finally, DANE, based on the work that it has carried out in recent years as a member of the working group of Satellite Images and Geospatial Data of the UN Big Data for Official Statistics, recognizes the importance of both the use of data and technological platforms, as well as of the interinstitutional coordination that is necessary for the fulfillment of the goals and for the formulation of public policies that pursue this integral and multi-sectorial agenda in terms of the use and exploitation of new sources of Smart Data.		1				1		7.69230769230769				1.0752688172043

Q05.2a	Details on new technologies or methodologies used to ensure timely release of survey results and/or statistical publications/bulletins	R01		Centralized IT and methodological units ensure the effective performance of statistical processes. Usually, IT Development and Methodology and Quality divisions (as coordinators) within their competence and all statistical divisions are involved in the implementation of projects or introduction of IT systems or other systems for modernization of statistical production processes. The examples of such projects can be the development of the Official Statistics Portal allowing to access official statistics produced by different institutions on a single contact point principle; IT system (e.statistics) enabling electronic preparation and transmission of statistical data from enterprises and population; Metadata management system, allowing effective preparation and dissemination, as well as archiving of metadata; a modern 2011 Population and Housing Census data collection and processing technology â€“ a computerized system based on cloud computing. With regard to improving statistical data processing methods, methodologies are regularly deliberated and improved by the Methodology Commission of Statistics Lithuania according to the annual plans on deliberation of draft statistical survey methodologies. The commission also deliberates the draft statistical survey (work) methodologies or other methodological documents prepared by the other national authorities. Statistics Lithuania implements the projects, considering the web scraping in such areas as price and job vacancies statistics. Moreover, the EU-recommended statistical data editing and missing value imputation methods using standard IT tools have been implemented; the proportion of statistical indicators for the calculation of whose estimates additional information or administrative data are used have been increased; centralized management of data obtained from administrative sources has been introduced, etc.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043

Q05.2a	Details on new technologies or methodologies used to ensure timely release of survey results and/or statistical publications/bulletins	R01		For example : Flash estimates on poverty rateEvery year in September N+2, INSEE publishes the poverty rate and the main indicators of inequalities in standard of living for year N. This delay is unsatisfactory for meeting the social requirements of users of these indicators. Of the 21 months between the end of the year under consideration and the publication of the poverty rate, about three-quarters of this time is taken up collecting tax and social data, and about one quarter with statistically matching Labour Force Survey (LFS) data, from which the Tax and Social Incomes Survey (ERFS) is produced. Nowcasting consists of producing an earlier indicator (in autumn N+1) of the poverty rate for the target year N based on the ERFS N-1. The method to be used here is microsimulation, which simulates individuals' standard of living by imputing benefits and contributions on scales, and allows to take account of any legal changes in the social and tax legislation. The exercise is based on the INES model, which simulates the majority of French social security and tax legislation, based on any year of the ERFS. To implement nowcasting, one important step is ageing population by uprating incomes (using surveys about wages, aggregated tax data, inflation...) and calibration weighting (using margins from LFS and census). Reverse ageing is also used so that evaluations for year N and N-1 (and thus annual evolutions) are only based on the ERFS N-1 (that is minimising the sample bias). In this paper, we present the methodology and assess the quality of the early indicators thus produced. Indeed, we compare the results that would have been produced by microsimulation with those that were in fact disseminated from the ERFS. When applied to the target years 2010 to 2015, this method produced estimations similar to the actual figures published the following year for the poverty rate and the main indicators of inequalities.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043

The ABS's ambitious transformation agenda is arguably the most significant and comprehensive change in its history. The transformation is essential for the continued production of timely, relevant and quality statistical information required to inform decisions in a rapidly changing world. Beginning in 2014-15, the ABS transformation is underpinned by an investment of $257 (AUD) million to modernise infrastructure over five years through the Statistical Business Transformation Program (see recommendation 3 for more information). The Statistical Business Transformation Program is responsible for designing and developing the next generation of statistical business processes and supporting information infrastructure to provide a platform to reduce costs and burden on providers, bring together various datasets to develop new statistical products more rapidly, and make data available in a form which can be more easily used. The transformation program is focused on building capacity on six key areas: environment, strategy, governance, people, culture and infrastructure.					1	1					25	1.0752688172043
