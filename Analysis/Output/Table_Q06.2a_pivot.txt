Statistics Denmark was ordered by a law to disclose statistical data on educational attainment for administrative and control purposes in 2017 â€“ in conflict with FPOS. Statistics Denmark consider it as a serious breach if researchers send home data containing deidentified microdata from Statistics Denmark's research computers. Since 2014 there has been close to 90 breaches, where researchers have sent home microdata. The normal sanction for a breach is one month exclusion from access to microdata for the research environment, that has committed the breach. If the research environment reports a breach to Statistics Denmark, then it is considered a mitigating circumstance, and the exclusion will be shorter than one month.
