Q10.2	Ways in which international cooperation has affected the functioning of your NSS	117	19	Americas	21	Northern America			United States of America	840	USA				Developed	Participation in technical working groups with UN organizations and other countries has widen the perspective of many NSO managers. Most NSOs operate within limited resources to perform their agency mission; in many cases, this means meeting non-negotiable data/media releases on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, as well as researching improvement methodologies.In many cases, UN requests involve lengthy surveys and/or require special calculations. For example, when detail data at disaggregate levels are requested, I suspect ratios are applied to calculate the "splits"... which may or may not normally meet the quality standards of the agency's regularly-released data. Although, notations are made for transparency reasons, I do not think the UN entities pay that much attention to it.Increasing the understanding of where and why all the UN requests come from will lead to more cooperation.
