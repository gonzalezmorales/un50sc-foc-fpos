Q02.8	How NSO/NSS develops professional qualifications of staff	R01		Human Resources:The Australian Government has recognised the critical importance of developing capability for statistical purposes, outlined in the Data Skills and Capability in the Australian Public Service publication. This publication outlines a Data Skills and Capability Framework to improve overall data skills and capability across the Australian Public Service. The Learning Hub on the ABS website provided access to a range of statistical capability resources. The ABS publication Statistical Skills for Official Statisticians is a resource that provides guidance on the skills, knowledge, and expertise required for statistical production. The ABS recognises that its people are essential to successfully realising its transformation goals and achieving its vision and objectives. The ABS has identified that in order to deliver its transformation agenda, it needs to change its culture, drive high performance and build capability. To deliver on this, an ABS Strategic Workforce Plan is implemented through annual People and Culture Action Plans. Workforce strategies focus on: reshaping workforce capability; aligning staff profiles and structure to support a rationalised and responsive work program; building a high performance culture and improving diversity, leadership and collaboration. The ABS Strategic Workforce Plan links to a series of well-established people related plans and strategies. These include the Statistical Capability Plan, and a suite of diversity plans (Workplace Diversity Action Plan, Reconciliation Action Plan and the Gender Diversity Action Plan) which aim to attract and retain a diverse and capable workforce. To equip and enable an agile workforce, the ABS is currently implementing a flexible working environment. This offers ABS staff more flexible working conditions and provides cost savings through more efficient use of property. ABS staff can efficiently work from home, or remotely, through smarter use of technology, with all staff working from mobile computing devices on an enhanced computing network. The ABS's learning management system, CapabilityPlus, provides a contemporary blended learning environment â€“ providing easy online access to capability development options for field and office staff (as well as for external clients). To support efficient and effective work practices, staff can search a vast store of corporate knowledge online, covering corporate services, statistical services, policy and legislation and technological support though the ABS knowledge management system, Services@ABS.Develop staff qualificationsThe ABS has developed a statistical capability framework to guide building statistical capability internally, domestically and internationally. The framework has three dimensions: statistical use, statistical production, and statistical leadership. Associated with each of these dimensions are a range of statistical activities and statistical skills. The ABS also makes available to its staff a capability building resource known as Statistical Skills for Official Statisticians. The ABS graduate program is run annually and is a key part of how the ABS maintains capability. Many ABS graduates have backgrounds in relevant fields such as: economics, econometrics, statistics, information and communication technology, demography, business, mathematics, computer science and software engineering. ABS graduates are generally employed within one of four streams: statistical analysis and research, methodology, information and communication technology, and corporate. The ABS methodology division runs regular, comprehensive training courses in subjects such as survey methods, and a seminar and workshop series which regularly features external and international speakers aimed at building staff capability.
