Rules and guidelines for revisions and errors are included in the policy suite and within the quality framework. Much of the data collection, editing, processingâ€¦ are now done centrally. These areas have documented their processes and work closely with their clients to ensure high quality end result. All harmonized concepts and definitions, including variables and classifications, are documents and available for use.

Q03.5	Additional comments on challenges to the implementation of Principle 3	198	150	Europe	39	Southern Europe			Croatia	191	HRV				Developed	Regarding topic Dissemination, metadata and services CBS has established database of quality information (DBQI). DBQI became a key tool for quality assessment, quality documentation and quality reporting for CBS' surveys. Database content is based on an exhaustive list of quality information, which is further based on two widely accepted ESS structures, ESMS and ESQRS, divided in two parts: numerical information (meaning quality indicators which represent the most demanding part of the list of quality information which are gathered through the survey process) and descriptive (textual) information which refers directly to the survey quality assessment. All the information in the database can roughly be divided in two parts: 1) Numerical information, also called quality indicators. The whole list of quality indicators is divided in two parts: key indicators, which should be mandatory and calculated in all the surveys for which the quality assessment will be performed, and supportive indicators, which will be calculated if the survey manager considers them important for the quality assessment of a particular survey. 2) Descriptive (textual) information. This list can also be divided in two parts: information not directly connected to the quality assessment but aimed at describing the important characteristics of the survey, and information which refers directly to the survey quality assessment. To achieve the usefulness of this tool, the database itself had to be upgraded with a user-friendly application that enables easy inserting of information and management of inserted information. The first phase of development was devoted to the physical creation of the database and development of this user-friendly tool. The second phase is then devoted to the development of the management tool. At the beginning of the second phase we defined requirements for the output functionalities. These functionalities can be summarized as follows: â€¢ Survey manager authorization. Each survey manager should have the right to edit only specific surveys and view data from any survey. Survey manager must be checked before they start working with the application. This functionality is implemented by using Croatian metadata repository - CROMETA - web service. â€¢ Formatting of quality indicators into a readable (formatted) form. Application should enable creation of formatted tables from indicator values. This functionality is especially important for the sub-annual surveys. In these cases the table should summarize the values for the whole year. â€¢ Filling out the template for standard quality report. A quality report provides information on the main quality characteristics of a product for its users. Quality reports are normally based on quality indicators describing these characteristics and are important for both the producers and the management. The requirements of users and producers are different but a standard structure is preferable, so the application enables automatic transfer from the DBQI into the template for Standard Quality Report. Textual information from the database of quality information should be transferred unchanged, while the indicators should first be formatted into tables. One of the functionalities of the database of quality information is also easy and user-friendly creation of CBS's quality reports, which should be publicly available on our website. â€¢ Development of the basic analytical tool for comparative analyses of quality indicators. This tool should enable comparison for a selected reference period and for a selected indicator between all surveys. The comparison should be performed only on the level of the whole survey (no domains included). The tool should provide a list of indicator values for all the surveys for which the certain indicator is available on demand. â€¢ Creating XML for the ESS Metadata Handler (ESS MDH) â€“ export from one system to another. This application should enable automatic transfer from the DBQI into ESS MDH as well as vice versa, from ESS MDH into DBQI. Textual information from the database of quality information should be transferred unchanged, while the indicators should first be formatted and then transferred into the ESS MDH. â€¢ Supplementation of the information in the database (Documentation). The first part of the database, which contains textual information, should be supplemented with the information derived from documenting the statistical process. The list of items for this part is already prepared and consists of 36 sub-processes while each sub-process is further divided into 4 standard elements. â€¢ Integration with metadata repository â€œCROMETAâ€. Static lists added from CROMETA should be replaced with dynamic lists retrieved from CROMETA via web services. If any change appears in CROMETA it is automatically updated in the DBQI. â€¢ Development of the advanced analytical tool for comparative analyses of quality indicators. The application should enable two types of comparative analyses for a particular quality indicator: 1. Analyses through time. When a user selects a starting and ending date as a reference period, the application provides a time series of a selected quality indicator. The series are presented in the form of tables and line charts. 2. Analyses between domains. The application should enable two different domain comparisons. The first one takes into consideration the specific indicator values and specific reference period between the indicator values for a chosen domain in a specific survey (e.g. response rate for different regions in LFS in 1st quarter 2017). The second one enables a comparison between the different (selected) surveys. The values are presented in tabular and bar chart form.
