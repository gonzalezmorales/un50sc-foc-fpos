Q06.5	Additional comments on challenges to the implementation of Principle 6	220	9	Oceania	53	Australia and New Zealand			Australia	36	AUS				Developed	The Census and Statistics Act 1905 (CSA): requires the Australian Statistician to conduct the Census of Population and Housing every five years; requires the Australian Statistician to publish a quarterly population estimate for each Australian state and territory; empowers the Australian Statistician to collect statistical information on a broad range of demographic, economic, environmental and social topics; enables the Australian Statistician to legally direct a person to provide statistical information, and provides penalties for non-compliance with such a direction; requires the ABS to publish the results of all statistical collections; contains secrecy provisions that ensures any information relating to a person will not be released in a manner that is likely to enable the identification of that person, unless it is permitted by law; and places a life-long obligation on all ABS officers to maintain the secrecy of information collected under the CSA, and provides harsh penalties for those who fail to do so. Section 13 of the CSA provides for the Minister to make determinations allowing for the disclosure, with the approval in writing of the Australian Statistician, of information included in a specified class of information furnished in pursuance of the CSA. The Statistics Determination 1983 (the Determination) is such a determination which authorises the release of a restricted range of information under certain circumstances. The Determination is due to sunset on 1 October, 2018 and a new determination will be in force before that date. The Determination will provide a more flexible scheme under which business information can be released in sufficient detail to meet the analysis and decision making needs of governments, businesses and other stakeholders, whilst managing business expectations around the confidentiality of their commercial information. Section 19 of the CSA contains strong secrecy provisions which ensure information collected under the CSA is only disclosed where explicitly enabled by the CSA. All ABS officers are bound for life to maintain the secrecy of information collected under the CSA, and sign an undertaking of fidelity and secrecy upon commencement and at regular intervals throughout their employment. The CSA provides for harsh personal penalties should secrecy not be maintained. The CSA also provides for Regulations to be made to assist the Australian Statistician in performing their functions. These are contained within the Census and Statistics Regulation 2016.

Anonymizing data is also a challenge as it is easy to identify persons at the EA level (an EA is comprised of 100 households). Hence, the lowest level that data can be shared is at district level.
