Q04.5	Additional comments on challenges to the implementation of Principle 4	R01		While the ABS priorities remain essentially unchanged for the medium term we are very conscious of the need to adjust to the evolving expectations of the community and our customers in industry and government. It is important that we remain a trusted and reliable provider of official statistics and it is equally important that we continuously re-examine our information products and services to remain relevant. We will continue to consult widely with our stakeholders to ensure our choices reflect a sound balance between continuity and change, but change itself is necessary. The ABS is required to manage within the resources provided by Government and the Parliament, with user funding enabling us to deliver critical social statistics. The environment in which we are operating is challenging. There are increasing demands for new statistics and improved access to data. Our stakeholders expect quality statistics, first time every time, and we are confronting new business risks that are amplified while we transform our statistical business systems. When considering our corporate direction for 2018â€“19 and beyond, a number of key themes have been prominent: collaboration and partnering to build effectiveness and relevance; capital renewal to build systems resilience and stakeholder confidence; technical innovation to increase efficiency and enhance our capability to deliver in a more challenging environment; and workplace flexibility to maintain capacity. Underneath all of this change, the purpose and role of the ABS remains constant.	Oceania	1	1
