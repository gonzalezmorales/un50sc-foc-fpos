New statistical surveys or surveys which are subject to a major revision are discussed by the Methodological Council, which issues an opinion about the proposed changes. It is composed of ten members appointed by the SURS's Director-General. Three members are the employees of SURS and seven members are outside members â€“ experts from the field of statistical methodology from different scientific disciplines (in practice they are well known professors of statistics from the Universities). The Council is headed by the head of the Sector for Processes and Communication. The work of the Council is defined by the Instruction on the procedure for verification and approval of statistical surveys' methodology. Authorized producers are invited to participate at the sessions of the Council as observers, as well as to present their own statistical survey and benefit from the view of the experts.				1		1				2.85714285714286		1.0752688172043
