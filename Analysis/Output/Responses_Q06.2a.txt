Q06.2a	Examples of cases in which the confidentiality policy was violated in the past five years, and the sanctions that were applied	182	150	Europe	154	Northern Europe			Denmark	208	DNK				Developed	Statistics Denmark was ordered by a law to disclose statistical data on educational attainment for administrative and control purposes in 2017 â€“ in conflict with FPOS. Statistics Denmark consider it as a serious breach if researchers send home data containing deidentified microdata from Statistics Denmark's research computers. Since 2014 there has been close to 90 breaches, where researchers have sent home microdata. The normal sanction for a breach is one month exclusion from access to microdata for the research environment, that has committed the breach. If the research environment reports a breach to Statistics Denmark, then it is considered a mitigating circumstance, and the exclusion will be shorter than one month. Of the 90 breaches 45 percent have been self-reported. Statistics Denmark's confidentiality policy regarding researcher's access to microdata is more restrictive than required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). E.g. confidentiality breach under the research arrangement is normally not considered a breach on GDPR.
