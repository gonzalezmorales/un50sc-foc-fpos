Certification System of Statitistical Quality	Con un Comité Consultivo	European Union Statistical regulations	Eurostat Experts' regular statistical reviews of key statistical areas (e.g. methodological discussion on excessive deficit procedure (EDP) statistics and government finance statistics; information relating to the Lithuanian GNI data and inventory of sources and methods; review of statistical practices used to compile the HICP); OECD experts' review on the compliance with the OECD Council Recommendation on Good Statistical Practice.	Peer reviews on the European statistics Code of Practice	The Methodological Council was set up in order to have a review of the used statistical methods from the external experts of the academic community. New statistical surveys or surveys which are subject to a major revision are discussed by the Methodological Council, which issues an opinion about the proposed changes. It is composed of ten members appointed by the SURS's Director-General. Three members are the employees of SURS and seven members are outside members â€“ experts from the field of statistical methodology from different scientific disciplines (in practice they are well known professors of statistics from the Universities). The Council is headed by the head of the Sector for Processes and Communication. The work of the Council is defined by the Instruction on the procedure for verification and approval of statistical surveys' methodology. Authorized producers are invited to participate at the sessions of the Council as observers, as well as to present their own statistical survey and benefit from the view of the experts.	NA
