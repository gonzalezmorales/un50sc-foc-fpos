For the implementation of this important strategic goal, the Government of the Republic of Serbia formed the Open Data Working Group (for planning and coordination of activities related to the opening of data of public institutions). Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia is one of the active members. In order to improve the quality and availability of statistical data, the SORS is very dedicated to the development and improvement of dissemination, which includes the development of a statistical OpenData portal as an integral part of the national OpenData infrastructure of the Republic of Serbia.
