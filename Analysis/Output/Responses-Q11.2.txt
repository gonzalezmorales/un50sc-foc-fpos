Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	163	142	Asia	145	Western Asia			State of Palestine	275	PSE				Developing	The main challenges in implementing the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (FPOS), where the basic principles are related mainly to: Lack of effective human resources system of the partners' statistical units, ongoing internal change of the statistical units staff, weakness of the statistical capabilities of statisticians in the statistical units, weakness of the accumulation and exchange of experience among the partners' staff and this is due to turnover and new appointments, no commitment in using the approved concepts and terminology, as well as the differences in the use of classifications by partners' statistical units. Challenges that have to do with the ability to embed FPOS in the statistical law in explicit manner. Changes to statistical law that need to undergo very lengthy process. Experience has shown that the practice on the ground is what really matters when it comes to exercising FPOS regardless of the type (explicit or implicit reference to FPOS) or strengths of related legislations. Despite the existence of the law that there is still ineffective to force institutions to reach the official statistical number using all the classifications, concepts and terminology used at PCBS and ensure their unification. The ineffectiveness of the law to force the data-producing institutions to provide it to PCBS Absence of a law that guarantees accessing information by PCBS

Q11.2	Main challenges being faced in the implementation of the UNFPOS	194	150	Europe	154	Northern Europe			United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland	826	GBR				Developed	The UK Statistics Authority only produces approximately 60% of the Official Statistics within the UK. The remaining statistics are produced by other government departments, other public bodies, and other public facing bodies that are prescribed by legislation. This partially devolved system makes it difficult to enforce the FPOS across all producers of Official Statistics. Many bodies are part of the Government Statistical System and through a strong professional group we are able to promote the FPOS. Furthermore the UK Statistical System has the Office for Statistical Regulation, this body can investigate breaches of the Code of Practice, but it is not possible for the body to proactively oversee all the official statistics being produced in the UK.
