Q01.6b	Additional details on pre-release	R01		Pre-release access to statistical outputs from the Office for National Statistics (the NSO) ceased in July 2017 at the instruction of the National Statistician, other than for exceptional circumstances. The overarching principle is that an exceptional circumstance is where someone would need to act or make a decision in the public interest on the basis of the statistics. Not granting pre-release in such a case runs the risk of decisions being made on the basis of out of date information. Pre-release access granted exceptionally by the NSO is always fully transparent and documented here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/prereleaseaccess . The only exemptions to date have been given to the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee and the Office for Budget Responsibility.For other government departments that produce official statistics, pre-release access is regulated through the Statistics and Registration Services Act 2007 and associated Pre-Release Access to Official Statistics Orders for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This feeds through into the Code of Practice for Statistics. Ministers of the Crown and their equivalents in devolved governments may grant pre-release access through these Orders. The length of access allowed by the Orders varies. In England it is 24 hours. In Scotland, it is 5 days.Departments must publish a current list of all those who have pre-release access to each statistical release.	1	1
