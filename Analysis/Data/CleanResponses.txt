There is also an annual government budgeting process through which agencies may seek additional funding for specific initiatives or to respond to cost pressures. Governments must balance the extent to which statistical authorities are funded with other competing priorities. To deliver the best value while working within these resources, each statistical authority in the national statistical service must manage and prioritise statistical production. In real terms the funding of the ABS has reduced substantially in recent years and this trend is set to continue. ABS is working with government funding agencies and key users to retain a workable and stable financial situation, so that it can continue to deliver the official statistics Australia needs to the high levels of quality expected. The adequacy of resources is regularly monitored by statistical authorities in order to effectively manage and prioritise the statistical work program and leverage the regular government budget processes. The ABS Resource Prioritisation and Finance Committee and associated Working Group, for example, meet at least quarterly, or as frequently as weekly when required, to oversee and monitor allocations and expenditure to ensure rigour, discipline and transparency. The Committee comprises senior staff including the ABS Chief Financial Officer. There are a number of strategies that enable the production of official statistics within available resources. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has: 1. focused on achieving efficiencies by reducing corporate overheads, including reducing property costs through activity based working; 2. increased the use of administrative and transactional data collected by other entities in order to reduce direct costs to collect information from households and businesses; and 3. prioritised statistical activities and ceased some activities. The ABS classifies its statistical work program in four tiers, which are used to assist with prioritisation undertaken by the ABS. The tiers were informed by the development of the list of Essential Statistical Assets for Australia. The Essential Statistical Assets (ESA) for Australia initiative highlights statistics which are critical to decision making in Australia. The initiative contributes to effective prioritisation of investment by governments to improve the overall quality of Australia's official statistical assets, enhance their utilisation and allow for more effective integration to increase the value of the National Statistical System. The ESA was developed in consultation with the community as well as users and producers of statistics in Australia	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0		The ABS disseminates statistics covering economic, social, population and environment domains.

This publication outlines a Data Skills and Capability Framework to improve overall data skills and capability across the Australian Public Service. The Learning Hub on the ABS website provided access to a range of statistical capability resources. The ABS publication Statistical Skills for Official Statisticians is a resource that provides guidance on the skills, knowledge, and expertise required for statistical production. The ABS recognises that its people are essential to successfully realising its transformation goals and achieving its vision and objectives. The ABS has identified that in order to deliver its transformation agenda, it needs to change its culture, drive high performance and build capability. To deliver on this, an ABS Strategic Workforce Plan is implemented through annual People and Culture Action Plans. Workforce strategies focus on: reshaping workforce capability; aligning staff profiles and structure to support a rationalised and responsive work program; building a high performance culture and improving diversity, leadership and collaboration. The ABS Strategic Workforce Plan links to a series of well-established people related plans and strategies. These include the Statistical Capability Plan, and a suite of diversity plans (Workplace Diversity Action Plan, Reconciliation Action Plan and the Gender Diversity Action Plan) which aim to attract and retain a diverse and capable workforce. To equip and enable an agile workforce, the ABS is currently implementing a flexible working environment. This offers ABS staff more flexible working conditions and provides cost savings through more efficient use of property. ABS staff can efficiently work from home, or remotely, through smarter use of technology, with all staff working from mobile computing devices on an enhanced computing network. The ABS's learning management system, CapabilityPlus, provides a contemporary blended learning environment â€“ providing easy online access to capability development options for field and office staff (as well as for external clients). To support efficient and effective work practices, staff can search a vast store of corporate knowledge online, covering corporate services, statistical services, policy and legislation and technological support though the ABS knowledge management system, Services@ABS.Develop staff qualificationsThe ABS has developed a statistical capability framework to guide building statistical capability internally, domestically and internationally. The framework has three dimensions: statistical use, statistical production, and statistical leadership. Associated with each of these dimensions are a range of statistical activities and statistical skills. The ABS also makes available to its staff a capability building resource known as Statistical Skills for Official Statisticians. The ABS graduate program is run annually and is a key part of how the ABS maintains capability. Many ABS graduates have backgrounds in relevant fields such as: economics, econometrics, statistics, information and communication technology, demography, business, mathematics, computer science and software engineering. ABS graduates are generally employed within one of four streams: statistical analysis and research, methodology, information and communication technology, and corporate. The ABS methodology division runs regular, comprehensive training courses in subjects such as survey methods, and a seminar and workshop series which regularly features external and international speakers aimed at building staff capability.

This approach was successfully used in the recent Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey and is being used in the 2021 Census program.		Yes	Other lead Australian Government statistical authorities have a similar focus on ensuring privacy and follow similar privacy practices. In addition, the AIHW is guided by the AIHW Ethics Committee, established under Section 16 of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987, which, among a range of issues, considers compliance with the Privacy Act. The ABS offers ABS DataLab training on our website: http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/DataLab+Training+ScheduleThe Office of the Australian Information Commissioner also offers materials and resources to help Australian organisations and agencies develop or improve their privacy training programs.			1	0	1	1	1	0	0		1	1	1	1	0	1	All ABS Publications have a data quality declaration based on the ABS Data Quality Framework	1	1	1	1	1	0		0		1	1	1	1	1	0		0	50% or more	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0		0		Yes	1	1	1	0	0		0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0		Twice or more per year		Yes	Improving and reviewing quality There are several mechanisms in the Australian statistical system for data users to provide feedback about the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and accessibility of official statistical collections. This includes: regular review of the ABS forward work program; user consultation and engagement (which is also regularly reviewed) (see figure 1 and 2); the biennial ABS stakeholder relationship health assessment; Essential Statistical Assets initiative to identify priority statistics and assess quality; National Agricultural Statistics Review; and external and independent reviews as needed (e.g. APSC Capability Review, 2016 Census independent assurance panel quality assessment, independent technical review into the Labour Force Survey). Figure 1 â€“ ABS engagement pathways Figure 2 â€“ Key stakeholder fora		While the ABS priorities remain essentially unchanged for the medium term we are very conscious of the need to adjust to the evolving expectations of the community and our customers in industry and government. It is important that we remain a trusted and reliable provider of official statistics and it is equally important that we continuously re-examine our information products and services to remain relevant. We will continue to consult widely with our stakeholders to ensure our choices reflect a sound balance between continuity and change, but change itself is necessary. The ABS is required to manage within the resources provided by Government and the Parliament, with user funding enabling us to deliver critical social statistics. The environment in which we are operating is challenging. There are increasing demands for new statistics and improved access to data. Our stakeholders expect quality statistics, first time every time, and we are confronting new business risks that are amplified while we transform our statistical business systems. When considering our corporate direction for 2018â€“19 and beyond, a number of key themes have been prominent: collaboration and partnering to build effectiveness and relevance; capital renewal to build systems resilience and stakeholder confidence; technical innovation to increase efficiency and enhance our capability to deliver in a more challenging environment; and workplace flexibility to maintain capacity. Underneath all of this change, the purpose and role of the ABS remains constant.	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0		1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	Data Integration	1	0	1	1	0	0		1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0		The ABS is currently implementing a wide reaching transformation agenda to enable the ABS to achieve its purpose and ensure that its systems, process and methods remain relevant and functional. The ABS's ambitious transformation agenda is arguably the most significant and comprehensive change in its history. The transformation is essential for the continued production of timely, relevant and quality statistical information required to inform decisions in a rapidly changing world. Beginning in 2014-15, the ABS transformation is underpinned by an investment of $257 (AUD) million to modernise infrastructure over five years through the Statistical Business Transformation Program (see recommendation 3 for more information). The Statistical Business Transformation Program is responsible for designing and developing the next generation of statistical business processes and supporting information infrastructure to provide a platform to reduce costs and burden on providers, bring together various datasets to develop new statistical products more rapidly, and make data available in a form which can be more easily used. The transformation program is focused on building capacity on six key areas: environment, strategy, governance, people, culture and infrastructure.	0	1	0	0	0	1	ABS Data Quality Framework, IMF SDDS Framework	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	The ABS uses data quality gates and has invested in risk management frameworks and strategies	0	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	The ABS does not have a certification process which guarantees the official nature of statistics produced in various parts of the NSS.

Disclosures under the Determination are strictly limited in their scope and are articulated within ABS legislation and internal ABS policy. The Determination does not permit the release personal or sensitive information of natural persons to a third party.	The Census and Statistics Act 1905 (CSA): requires the Australian Statistician to conduct the Census of Population and Housing every five years; requires the Australian Statistician to publish a quarterly population estimate for each Australian state and territory; empowers the Australian Statistician to collect statistical information on a broad range of demographic, economic, environmental and social topics; enables the Australian Statistician to legally direct a person to provide statistical information, and provides penalties for non-compliance with such a direction; requires the ABS to publish the results of all statistical collections; contains secrecy provisions that ensures any information relating to a person will not be released in a manner that is likely to enable the identification of that person, unless it is permitted by law; and places a life-long obligation on all ABS officers to maintain the secrecy of information collected under the CSA, and provides harsh penalties for those who fail to do so. Section 13 of the CSA provides for the Minister to make determinations allowing for the disclosure, with the approval in writing of the Australian Statistician, of information included in a specified class of information furnished in pursuance of the CSA. The Statistics Determination 1983 (the Determination) is such a determination which authorises the release of a restricted range of information under certain circumstances. The Determination is due to sunset on 1 October, 2018 and a new determination will be in force before that date. The Determination will provide a more flexible scheme under which business information can be released in sufficient detail to meet the analysis and decision making needs of governments, businesses and other stakeholders, whilst managing business expectations around the confidentiality of their commercial information. Section 19 of the CSA contains strong secrecy provisions which ensure information collected under the CSA is only disclosed where explicitly enabled by the CSA. All ABS officers are bound for life to maintain the secrecy of information collected under the CSA, and sign an undertaking of fidelity and secrecy upon commencement and at regular intervals throughout their employment. The CSA provides for harsh personal penalties should secrecy not be maintained. The CSA also provides for Regulations to be made to assist the Australian Statistician in performing their functions. These are contained within the Census and Statistics Regulation 2016.

Data.gov.au is a product of the Australian Government's Declaration of Open Government and enables access to data published by Australian Government departments and public institutions. Most of the data available is free of charge and can be visualised using the in-built mapping tools. Individuals and organisations are encouraged to use the data on this site for research, study or applications that add value to the global community. In addition to open datasets, data.gov.au includes information about unpublished public sector data and data available for purchase.		The ABS operates in a complex statistical system which is not recognised by legislation. The role and responsibilities of all producers of statistics are not clearly determined by law. While there are some opportunities to improve coordination in the Australian statistical system, responsibilities for the co-ordination of the Australian Statistical System are laid out in the Census and Statistics Act 1905.	2008 SNA	Australia's national accounts statistics are compiled in accordance with international standards contained in the System of National Accounts, 2008 (SNA08). Australia's application of these SNA standards is described in Australian System of National Accounts: Concepts, Sources and Methods (cat. no. 5216.0). The current version of this product reflects the SNA08 concepts and was released in March 2016. This publication outlines major concepts and definitions, describes sources of data and methods used to derive annual and quarterly estimates for major aggregates at current prices and in chain volume terms, and discusses the accuracy and reliability of the national accounts. In addition, it includes documentation on input-output tables, financial accounts, capital stock, productivity measures, balance sheets and state accounts.

As part of this package the Australian Bureau of Statistics will reinstate the Time Use Survey (TUS). The ABS will receive $10.4 million to develop and conduct the survey, last run in 2006. These funds include the design, development and implementation of an electronic diary (in addition to a paper diary). The initial survey will be conducted in 2020-21 followed by a smaller ongoing annual survey that will build up the evidence base over time.As the development and consultation around this survey is still in the early stages, we cannot state definitively whether it will implement ICATUS 2016	1	0	0	0	Yes	Most ABS data is accessible to other NSOs and international organisations through the ABS website. Analysts from international organisations can also access ABS data through customised requests or confidentialised unit record files. The ABS is committed to responding to international questionnaires. Additionally, the ABS has an online product called ABS.Stat that presents data in a searchable, flexible and dynamic way. ABS.Stat provides data in a machine-processable format using the Statistical Data and Metadata Standard (SDMX) allowing machine-to-machine mechanisms for accessing and sharing ABS data, particularly to other NSO and international organisations. By 2019, ABS data and metadata will be instantly available upon release and updated in customer environments via an automated machine-to-machine access channel, without the need for any intervention.			1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	Building international statistical capability: The ABS is funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to deliver initiatives under the aid program through bilateral arrangements with NSOs under DFAT's regional economic governance initiatives. The ABS also partners with DFAT to support regional statistical capability development and institutional strengthening under the Australian Government's foreign policy priorities and aid program, assisting to enhance economic governance, regional security and stability, improve institutions, promote prosperity and enhance accountability. At the time of this assessment, the ABS supports five long-term partnerships to provide technical assistance and statistical leadership support. These partnerships are with: ï‚· Indonesia; ï‚· Timor-Leste; ï‚· Papua New Guinea; ï‚· Fiji; and ï‚· the Pacific region. The Australian Statistician has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the counterpart Chief Statistician for most of these programs, which articulates the partnership principles, mutual obligations and the parameters of our engagement with each country. For example, Statistics Indonesia and the ABS have had agreements in place for over 20 years and recently signed a milestone five-year agreement broadening the collaboration of statistical activities.	N/A			Yes	Public Data Commission and Regional Statistical Development Work (as mentioned above in International Engagement)		The ABS is a regular attendee of the UNSC and is a supporter and advocate for the work of the UNSD in the promotion of the UNs Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (UNFPOS) across the Australian Statistical system and internationally.	The emergence of many new data providers and competitors in the face of declining funding and challenging resource constraints, it makes it hard to continue to deliver the same volume and level of high quality statistics. The ABS is having to think smarter and be leaner in order to maintain the standard it has consistently set for its 110 year history.Another key challenge is how widely the UNFPOS principles are adopted across other key NSO's and NSS' particularly for comparability and best practice purposes.	Australian Statistics Advisory Council (ASAC) will identify opportunities and strategies to improve the coordination and effectiveness of Australia's statistical system, supporting initiatives such as: Stronger alignment with, and application of, the UN Fundamental Principles of Statistics by all levels of government in Australia. This should include further discussion and agreement between the Commonwealth and states and territories to maximise the development of administrative data for official statistical purposes through sharing and statistical data integration.Furthermore, any refresh or review of the UNFPOS principles provides an opportunity for the ABS to review itself whilst also considering how the broader NSS system within Australia operates. In addition, it gives us a chance to engage with key stakeholders and ascertain the needs and the quality of the data we produce.	More broadly, the UNFPOS principles need to consider emerging areas of complexity, particularly around optimising the public value of public (big data) assets, data integration, multimodal approaches whilst considering social licence impacts and maintaining community trust in official statistics.	300

Groups are consistently detailed into subgroups and activities.	0	1	0	0	No		Belstat is currently exploring the possibility of using SDMX for data transmission to the Eurasian Economic Commission, a national reporting platform for SDGs is being developed using the SDMX standard, which will be launched in early 2019. The main problems related to SDMX implementation are as follows: â€¢ insufficient training of NSS professionals; â€¢ lack of description of DSD structures from the Eurasian Economic Commission; â€¢ lack of technical assistance.	The Strategy for the development of state statistics of the Republic of Belarus until 2022 provides for further harmonization of the applied statistical classifications with their international analogues: development and implementation of the classification of environmental protection activities for harmonization with the international classification of environmental protection activities and environmental protection expenditures (CEPA 2000); development of the statistical classification of the main industrial groups for harmonization with the international classification of the main industrial groups (MIGS) and ensuring the comparability of official statistical information by groups of goods: investment, intermediate, consumer, energy. The development of the system of national accounts includes: to increase the detailing of goods and services within the input-output table system; to produce estimates, in line with the provisions of the 2008 SNA, of insurance services using the correction factor for paid indemnities, reinsurance services by estimating the output of direct insurance services; to produce experimental estimates of illegal activities and analyze the reliability of estimates for a number of years; to participate in the International Ccomparison Pprogram roubds for the assessment of purchasing power parity and obtaining of basic macroeconomic statistics; to integrate the financial account into the system of national accounts; to estimate the value of certain types of assets in the framework of the national wealth indicators. It is also planned to: increase the comparability of business statistics at the international level by harmonizing the frequency, methodology for defining statistical indicators, statistical units and other approaches with international standards and Eurostat recommendations; develop labour market statistics in compliance with the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labor underutilization adopted at the 19th International Conference of Labor Statisticians, in particular, develop a methodology for unpaid labor activities; collect data on agriculture in the framework of the 2019 population census of the Republic of Belarus on statistical indicators included in the main set of questions recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the framework of the 2020 World Census of Agriculture Program; develop a system of finance statistics indicators in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards; improve the classification system of retail goods by harmonizing it with the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP); improve the system of indicators of the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) in line with international recommendations and related official statistical methodology; introduce environmental-economic accounts in statistical practice; carry out the sixth round of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for the Assessment of the Situation of Children and Women (MICS6).	1	1	1	0	1	1	0		0	Thanks to cooperation with international organizations and foreign statistical offices in the course of consistent implementation of medium-term strategic programmes for the development of state statistics, we managed to create a legal framework, a system of statistical indicators and a methodology of their compilation based on international standards and rules.

The Republic of Belarus was elected a member of the United Nations Statistical Commission for 2017â€“2020. In the work of the International Comparison Program Governing Board and the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal indicators, Belstat represents not only the interests of the Republic of Belarus, but also of the region as a whole. In 2016â€“2020, it is planned to develop and implement several UNDAF, UNICEF and UNFPA international technical assistance projects; it is also planned to expand the project activities within the framework of the Programmatic Multilateral Trust Fund of the World Bank (ECASTAT).	In 2016, a new version of the Law on State Statistics of the Republic of Belarus came into force, which complies with the Generic Law on Official Statistics developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Compilation of official statistical information in the Republic of Belarus is carried out in line with the principles of state statistics harmonized with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and the European Statistics Code of Practice. Compliance with these principles was evaluated by international expert statisticians in 2012 during the Adapted Global Assessment of the National Statistical System. In 2015-2017, the National Model of Processes for the Production of Official Statistical Information based on GSBPM (Version 5.0) was developed and adopted, the main statistical production processes were described; the Indicators of the state statistics principles, the Quality Policy, the Policy of primary data confidentiality, the Policy for dissemination of official statistical information and the Policy for the revision of official statistical information were developed and adopted; the quality management system for primary data and official statistical information was developed and implemented in accordance with STB ISO 9001-2015. From January 1, 2016, the main provisions of the 2008 SNA have been introduced into statistical practice, which are the basis for ensuring the comparability of official statistical information at the international level.	Wider use of administrative data, quality assessment, publication of quality reports	The implementation of the Strategy for the Development of State Statistics of the Republic of Belarus until 2022 will allow to: create an effective quality management system for statistical production that complies with the STB ISO 9001-2015 requirements, and ensure its effectiveness at all levels of the system of state statistical bodies; ensure the optimization of information flows and eliminate duplication in the work of the national statistical system; make the most of information technology and equipment that meet modern technical requirements for statistical production; optimize statistical tools and approaches to the use of administrative data to reduce the reporting burden on respondents; ensure continuous work to improve statistical literacy and user awareness; use international practices and modern means of communication in the development of multi-channel approaches to dissemination of official statistical information; build a system of statistical indicators that meets the needs of a wide range of users. Results of the Adapted Global Assessment of the National Statistical System which is scheduled for 2019 with the support of Eurostat will allow for identifing new directions for improving state statistical activities based on the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.	Assistance in developing approaches to adapt the SDMX standard for dissemination of official statistical information. Participation in twinning projects to assess the quality of administrative data. Participation in international seminars, meetings, workshops on the exchange of best practices for improving state statistical activities on the basis of the United Nations Principles of Official Statistics.	240

The Statistics Act has embedded the principles and they are fully implemented. Sensitization to stakeholders on the principles is continuously done across the NSS.	None, except where producers are not aware and measures will put in place to address the situation.	As we implement the NSDS and more sectors enrolled into the process, it increase awareness as well as implementation across the NSS and thus making the NSS be more effective.	By assisting with the auditing skills in performance of countries in implementing the UNFPOS, develop a system which assist us to track our performance with respect to implementation of the principles; use the UNFPOS index or scores to measure implementation rate for comparability between countries; provide technical assistance in the development of a Module or course content in Official Statistics; Currently the organization is collaborating with the Universities to see how they can provide capacity building in Official Statistics.	90

The SDMX format is one of the data formats available to the general public. A SDMX-ML data (compact format) file and the accompanying DSD (Data Structure Definition) file is available at release time for the disseminated data tables through our website www.statcan.gc.ca. The SDMX files are also available on the Canadian Open Data Portal which is available at the following website http://open.canada.ca.2) Statistics Canada has an obligation to supply data to many international organizations such as OECD, IMF, UN, World Bank, etc. Currently Statistics Canada is providing data in a SDMX format which aligns to the following internationally approved global data structure definitions for the following domains; a. OECD â€“ Main Aggregates b. OECD â€“ Sector Accounts. OECD â€“ Supply Use Tables. IMF â€“ Balance of Payments. IMF â€“ SDDS+3) Statistics Canada uses SDMX to facilitate and manage data exchanges to fulfil the needs of our Fiscal Arrangements program. The government of Canada permanently offers financial support to the provincial and territorial governments to help them fund social programs and services. There are 4 major transfer programs: Canada Health Transfer (CHT), Canada Social Transfer (CST), Equalization and the Territorial Financing Formula. These 4 transfer programs are regulated by the Fiscal Arrangements Act. Statistics Canada is responsible for the preparation and delivery of data related to the Fiscal Arrangements. The Public Sector Statistics Division is responsible to collect and assemble data from over 40 different data sources from Statistics Canada and to finalize a number of certificates to the Canadian Department of Finance.			1	1	1	0	1	1	0		0	International cooperation promotes the development and implementation of international standards and frameworks, enabling StatCan to provide a consistent and coherent picture of the Canadian economy, society and environment.

Strong, internationally comparable statistics allow Canadians to make informed decisions affecting their own lives and futures. Knowledge and experience gained through various international activities supports the development of a modern, engaged, self-reliant and innovative work force. International knowledge-sharing offers unique opportunities for employees to explore other countries' tools and methods, and fosters innovation at Statistics Canada.	N/A			Yes	Government of Canada Open Data		Revised Statistics Act in 2017, strengthening independence, role of the Chief Statistician, stronger process to obtain administrative data		Stronger coordination across the NSS; Canada data strategy	International Organisations can contribute to implementation of the UNFPOS by advocating for them generally, and for promoting the specific principles, including supporting strong statistical legislation that highlights the importance of independence and neutrality of the National Statistical Office (Overall support of FPOS but also â€“ specific to Principle 1 and 2). Moreover, international organizations can also advocate for better funding of National Statistics Offices by highlighting the importance of robust data and statistics as a necessary condition for good governance. This supports Principle 1. Finally, International organizations can promote the role of the NSO as the coordinator of statistical for the NSS in support not only of strong coordination, but also to ensure quality (Principles 1,2,3,5,8)	180

The strategy is based on the implementation of pilot projects that in their majority integrate or complement traditional information from administrative records, censuses and surveys with non-traditional sources such as Earth observation data, detailed mobile phone records, social networks, and information from web pages of enterprises, among others. Once the piloting or exploration phase has been completed, and, according to the viability of the results, the incorporation process begins, which involves reviewing the aspects related to the technological infrastructure required for the incorporation, the verification of compliance with quality standards and attributes as well as the generation of necessary skills in human resources. Also, as a result of this strategy, DANE has made progress in incorporating innovations in the information collection process by making use of new technologies. A specific case is the first electronic census (eCensus) conducted in Colombia, which in addition to providing an easy, fast and secure questionnaire, also had mechanisms for verifying the identity of the persons, for the purpose of ensuring the quality and truthfulness of the information reported, through the consultation in real time of the National Registry web service. In order to ensure the georeferencing of these units, DANE integrated information from administrative records and geocoding services; as a result, the georeferencing of 97% of the registered units was achieved. DANE has also explored the use of mobile telephony data and its applications in statistical production, in such a way that within the framework of the project "Measuring the information society" -that had the participation of DANE, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and the International Telecommunications Union-, in 2017, it was possible to have access to information of detailed records of mobile phones, guarded by private companies. The access to this type of source continues however to be one of the main challenges to overcome. Finally, DANE, based on the work that it has carried out in recent years as a member of the working group of Satellite Images and Geospatial Data of the UN Big Data for Official Statistics, recognizes the importance of both the use of data and technological platforms, as well as of the interinstitutional coordination that is necessary for the fulfillment of the goals and for the formulation of public policies that pursue this integral and multi-sectorial agenda in terms of the use and exploitation of new sources of Smart Data.	0	1	0	0	1	1		0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0		0	1	0	1	0	0	0		0	DANE, as the leading and coordinating body of the National Statistical System (NSS) of Colombia, is responsible, among other things, for the assurance of the quality with respect to the statistical information produced by the members of the NSS. In order to ensure statistical quality, DANE has been carrying out certification processes since 2006 by means of evaluating the statistical operations of the System. In total, 255 quality evaluations have been carried out, where 81% of the operations under assessment have obtained a certification (PEN, 2017: 7). This process was formalized in 2016, by establishing the quality assessment as a mandatory condition of official statistics in Colombia. The statistical quality evaluation process is carried out based on the Statistical Process Quality Technical Standard (NTC-PE 1000), deemed to be the first technical quality standard worldwide in which requirements are established with respect to the statistical process. The entities producing statistics are subject to quality evaluation according to the Annual Statistical Evaluation Program, which it is published one year in advance. The fulfillment of the Technical Standard is evaluated by a Commission of Independent Experts (CEI), consisting of three independent evaluators (experts in the thematic area, statistics and statistical process respectively). Once the Commission presents its recommendation, a Certification Committee that has not participated in the evaluation, issues its decision pertaining to the certification in statistical quality of the evaluated entity, based on the CEI report. The certification is a guarantee of quality with respect to the statistical information produced and provides trust in the use of information. The certification is valid for five years; however, in order to ensure continuous improvement, based on the findings of the assessment, the entity responsible for the statistical operation must present an improvement plan and conduct a self-evaluation with respect to the progress made in such plan and other improvement actions that it may have identified, annually, and subsequently present the report to DANE. This experience has allowed both DANE and the NSS to generate new developments, facilitating the institutional coordination with the entities of the System and promoting the standardization of processes. Furthermore, it is a pioneering process that can be replicated in other statistical systems in the region. By the end of 2018, approximately 30 statistical operations of the SEN will have been evaluated.

In particular, the regulation allows exchanges of information to the extent that the purpose is oriented towards the production or improvement of official statistical information in Colombia. The body which decides on whether or not performing these exchanges is the National Advisory Council for Statistics (CANE), which is made up of 11 members of the public, private and academic sectors, at the national and regional levels. The requests can be made by any member of the SEN, establishing the official statistics that will be improved or the information gap that it intends to meet by means of the production of new official statistics. Based on the request as well as the justification on the development and the statistical impact that the use of the microdata will generate in Colombia, the Council conducts a voting process with absolutely majority criteria thereof all member attending the meeting, must agree upon the exchange process. Once the decision is issued, the NSS entity which is responsible for the information relating to the exchange is obliged to comply with it. To date, three exchanges with respect to information of non-anonymised microdata have been carried out between the Central Bank of Colombia and DANE. These exchanges were associated with the improvement in the production of official statistics in the services industry and international trade.	We do not have further comments about this principle.

The new base of national accounts presented several innovative aspects for the users of the NSS, in terms of the best international practices, specifically, elements such as the following were highlighted: The revision and inclusion of international recommendations proposed by the 2008 SNA, such as the treatment of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM), the measurement of research and development as gross fixed capital formation, the explicit calculation of the non-observed economy, and the institutional classification of the financial sector, among others.

The UNFPOS had allowed to Colombia developing different statistical policies such as the National Statistical Plan (PEN), which is issued for a term of five years and has the purpose of maintaining and increasing the supply of quality official statistics; the Technical Standard for the Quality of the Statistical Process, which establishes the quality requirements for the Generation of Statistics - NTCPE 1000: 2017 (DANE Resolution 1418 of 2017) and the guidelines for the statistical process production.These documents have allowed fulfilling the intended purposes of the UNFPOS, taking into account in their scope for both the NSS and NSO.	While the strengthening of the National Statistical System in Colombia has been improved and recognized in the statistical community, it has been observed some important challenges in order to maintain the implementation of the UNFPOS: It is necessary to make efforts to keep the institutional arrangements for the National Statistical System. Especially, it has been observed the importance to follow and accomplish the goals that were planned in the National Statistical Strategy. Another challenge has to do with the role of the DANE as governing body and the need to create a strengthening of instruments which allows improving the coordination among the NSS members.	Taking into account the changes observed in the NSS through the implementation of UNFPOS by means of different mechanisms in the country, it is possible to consider that for the next 10 years, Colombia will increase the trust and credibility of the statistics produced not only by the NSO, but by the NSS members. We also believe that the UNFPA could provide a framework which allows us to have more and better statistics in Colombia.	We consider that UNFPOS could strengthen the international cooperation for the statistical activity in Colombia. On the other hand, we consider this international technical cooperation and knowledge management will allow sharing good statistical practices in order to implement and evaluate the accomplishment of the UNFPOS	300

DBQI became a key tool for quality assessment, quality documentation and quality reporting for CBS' surveys. Database content is based on an exhaustive list of quality information, which is further based on two widely accepted ESS structures, ESMS and ESQRS, divided in two parts: numerical information (meaning quality indicators which represent the most demanding part of the list of quality information which are gathered through the survey process) and descriptive (textual) information which refers directly to the survey quality assessment. All the information in the database can roughly be divided in two parts: 1) Numerical information, also called quality indicators. The whole list of quality indicators is divided in two parts: key indicators, which should be mandatory and calculated in all the surveys for which the quality assessment will be performed, and supportive indicators, which will be calculated if the survey manager considers them important for the quality assessment of a particular survey. 2) Descriptive (textual) information. This list can also be divided in two parts: information not directly connected to the quality assessment but aimed at describing the important characteristics of the survey, and information which refers directly to the survey quality assessment. To achieve the usefulness of this tool, the database itself had to be upgraded with a user-friendly application that enables easy inserting of information and management of inserted information. The first phase of development was devoted to the physical creation of the database and development of this user-friendly tool. The second phase is then devoted to the development of the management tool. At the beginning of the second phase we defined requirements for the output functionalities. These functionalities can be summarized as follows: â€¢ Survey manager authorization. Each survey manager should have the right to edit only specific surveys and view data from any survey. Survey manager must be checked before they start working with the application. This functionality is implemented by using Croatian metadata repository - CROMETA - web service. â€¢ Formatting of quality indicators into a readable (formatted) form. Application should enable creation of formatted tables from indicator values. This functionality is especially important for the sub-annual surveys. In these cases the table should summarize the values for the whole year. â€¢ Filling out the template for standard quality report. A quality report provides information on the main quality characteristics of a product for its users. Quality reports are normally based on quality indicators describing these characteristics and are important for both the producers and the management. The requirements of users and producers are different but a standard structure is preferable, so the application enables automatic transfer from the DBQI into the template for Standard Quality Report. Textual information from the database of quality information should be transferred unchanged, while the indicators should first be formatted into tables. One of the functionalities of the database of quality information is also easy and user-friendly creation of CBS's quality reports, which should be publicly available on our website. â€¢ Development of the basic analytical tool for comparative analyses of quality indicators. This tool should enable comparison for a selected reference period and for a selected indicator between all surveys. The comparison should be performed only on the level of the whole survey (no domains included). The tool should provide a list of indicator values for all the surveys for which the certain indicator is available on demand. â€¢ Creating XML for the ESS Metadata Handler (ESS MDH) â€“ export from one system to another. This application should enable automatic transfer from the DBQI into ESS MDH as well as vice versa, from ESS MDH into DBQI. Textual information from the database of quality information should be transferred unchanged, while the indicators should first be formatted and then transferred into the ESS MDH. â€¢ Supplementation of the information in the database (Documentation). The first part of the database, which contains textual information, should be supplemented with the information derived from documenting the statistical process. The list of items for this part is already prepared and consists of 36 sub-processes while each sub-process is further divided into 4 standard elements. â€¢ Integration with metadata repository â€œCROMETAâ€. Static lists added from CROMETA should be replaced with dynamic lists retrieved from CROMETA via web services. If any change appears in CROMETA it is automatically updated in the DBQI. â€¢ Development of the advanced analytical tool for comparative analyses of quality indicators. The application should enable two types of comparative analyses for a particular quality indicator: 1. Analyses through time. When a user selects a starting and ending date as a reference period, the application provides a time series of a selected quality indicator. The series are presented in the form of tables and line charts. 2. Analyses between domains. The application should enable two different domain comparisons. The first one takes into consideration the specific indicator values and specific reference period between the indicator values for a chosen domain in a specific survey (e.g. response rate for different regions in LFS in 1st quarter 2017). The second one enables a comparison between the different (selected) surveys. The values are presented in tabular and bar chart form.

Statistics Denmark consider it as a serious breach if researchers send home data containing deidentified microdata from Statistics Denmark's research computers. Since 2014 there has been close to 90 breaches, where researchers have sent home microdata. The normal sanction for a breach is one month exclusion from access to microdata for the research environment, that has committed the breach. If the research environment reports a breach to Statistics Denmark, then it is considered a mitigating circumstance, and the exclusion will be shorter than one month. Of the 90 breaches 45 percent have been self-reported. Statistics Denmark's confidentiality policy regarding researcher's access to microdata is more restrictive than required by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). E.g. confidentiality breach under the research arrangement is normally not considered a breach on GDPR.	1	1	0	1	0	1	0		0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0		0			Yes	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		0	According to the type of survey	0	1	0	1	1	0	0		0	Ministry of economic affairs, industry or trade		Yes	Yes		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	The term official statistics is new in Denmark.

N/A			Yes	Open data watch	Include thisprincipale in the updating of the Statistical Law and improve the communication of international cooperation at the level of other entities of the NSS to know what is taking place with other institutions	The fundamental principles of the statistical offices establised by the United Nations have been the main guidelines for the preparation of a technical proposal for the "Statistical Law", which will be the main input for its updatinf.	One of the main challenges for the proper application of the fundamental principles of statistics is the uptating of the Statistical Law that encompasses in general terms those principles and that are mandatory, of all entities of the NSS.	The implementation of UNFPOS in our country guarantees that the information produced is of quality, in addition to providing a greater scope to the users of the information, sensitizing both internal and external users the importance of having quality statistical information, for decision making at public police level based on evidence.	International organizations play an important role in the implementation of these principles, since they have a vast knowledge about them, knowledge that must be disseminated through different media or a web portal to access all statistical offices. In addition, we can work with international agencies on specific plans, such as accessibility issues, open data, confidentiality, quality of administrative records, among other topics of relevance for statistical offices; especially being the spokespersons in the NSS on the need to implement the principles of professional independence of statistical offices.	120

This delay is unsatisfactory for meeting the social requirements of users of these indicators. Of the 21 months between the end of the year under consideration and the publication of the poverty rate, about three-quarters of this time is taken up collecting tax and social data, and about one quarter with statistically matching Labour Force Survey (LFS) data, from which the Tax and Social Incomes Survey (ERFS) is produced. Nowcasting consists of producing an earlier indicator (in autumn N+1) of the poverty rate for the target year N based on the ERFS N-1. The method to be used here is microsimulation, which simulates individuals' standard of living by imputing benefits and contributions on scales, and allows to take account of any legal changes in the social and tax legislation. The exercise is based on the INES model, which simulates the majority of French social security and tax legislation, based on any year of the ERFS. To implement nowcasting, one important step is ageing population by uprating incomes (using surveys about wages, aggregated tax data, inflation...) and calibration weighting (using margins from LFS and census). Reverse ageing is also used so that evaluations for year N and N-1 (and thus annual evolutions) are only based on the ERFS N-1 (that is minimising the sample bias). In this paper, we present the methodology and assess the quality of the early indicators thus produced. Indeed, we compare the results that would have been produced by microsimulation with those that were in fact disseminated from the ERFS. When applied to the target years 2010 to 2015, this method produced estimations similar to the actual figures published the following year for the poverty rate and the main indicators of inequalities.	0	0	1	0	0	1		0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	1	1	1	1	0	0		0		Yes	NSS	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	No violation of confidentiality in the last five years	1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0		0	Two regulations apply:-National law on confidentiality, for all except data transmissions to Eurostat and others UE NSIs-UE regulation on european statistical system for Eurostat and alii	Statistical confidentiality may be lifted in the event of legal proceedings or in the context of the application of the law on successions, but the case has never occurred in France.

The main purpose of the 2014 major revision of national accounts was to implement the new â€œEuropean System of National and Regional Accountsâ€ (ESA 2010). The ESA 2010 itself is based on the worldwide SNA 2008.

Since Germany is integrated into the European Statistical System, the national classification of activities is based on the "Activity Coding List (ACL)" of the Harmomized European Time Use Survey (HETUS). According to Eurostat, the ACL of the next HETUS data round 2020 will not be replaced by ICATUS 2016; Nor will it build on the structure of ICATUS 2016. It is possible, however, that individual key components of the ICATUS 2016 will be included in the ACL of HETUS 2020. As part of the revised HETUS Guidelines 2018, the ACL of HETUS 2020 is expected to be adopted by the end of February 2019.	1	0	0	0	Yes	Destatis participates in the international initiative SDMX in connection with the transmission of national statistical results to Eurostat. The introduction takes place successively for individual statistics. Eurostat would like to make all statistic deliveries available in SDMX format. Basically, Destatis supports the use of SDMX because Eurostat provides this as a metadata Standard for European data deliveries.			1	1	1	1	1	0	1	Bileteral co-operation with different countries (Memorandum of Understanding)	0	Foreign assignments and activities of employees are supported and promoted. The goal is to give employees the chance to actively improve their proffecional skills in close co-operation with experts from other NSO's.	Yes	Germany receives support from the EU - for the "Feasibility Study for Setting up a Large Cases Unit (LCU) within the Statistical System of Germany" (EU Structural Reform Support Programme) - for the implementation of new methods of production of European statistics (EU Grants to provide financial support in different statistical Areas)		No		For more than 25 years, the FSO is actively engaged in the international co-operation. Especially, for the candidate countries for EU accession, the CIS countries and the People's Republic of China the FSO has been an often requested partner. The co-operation includes: - consultations in the partner countries to improve the production processes of statistical data, - organisation of study visits in Germany to present the German practice, - preparation and conducting of training courses, - assignement of experts for the further development of the statistical system through institutional improvements in cross-cutting areas (e.g. legal basis, quality management, dissemination of data and co-operation with users). In many cases of cooperation (funded by the World Bank or the EU) Germany is the leader of the relevant consortium of partners.		Preparing and releasing reliable statistics of a high quality is our main task. To do this properly, it is crucial at any time to follow the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. It continues to be a main challenge to preserve the core values of official statistics under tight budgetary constraints in a dynamic environment and various contexts such as interest based negotiations processes with different stakeholders. In this sense, it is a benefit to have the FPOS as a point of reference to which the Statistical Community has agreed on.	The European Code of Practice which was commonly developed between Eurostat and the National Statistical Institutes of the EU Member States is based on the UN Fundamental Prinicples. Further development of the Fundamental Principles and their implementation will be taken into consideration by improving the Code of Practice. In this context a close co-operation of international organisations (e.g. interagency working group) is essential in order to develop common standards.		1920

S'étant de l'objectif 4 . Le coà»t global de la mise en œuvre du plan d'action de la Stratégie nationale de développement de la statistique 2016-2020 s'élève à  444,2 milliards de GNF (54,8 millions USD), dont 110,5 milliards de GNF (24,9%) et 179,8 milliards de GNF (40,5%) Partenaires techniques financiers. Le montant total à  rechercher est de 153,9 milliards de GNF (34,6%), soit près de 19 millions USD. Le budget de la Stratégie nationale pour le développement de la statistique 2 servira principalement à  améliorer la qualité et la couverture de la production statistique (74,7%) et à  renforcer les capacités du système statistique national (21,3%). Le reste sera affecté à  l'amélioration de l'archivage, à  la diffusion, à  l'utilisation de données statistiques, à  la promotion de la recherche (2,7%) et au renforcement du système institutionnel et organisationnel du système statistique national (1,3%).

Ireland - Commitment on Confidence		In the current 24 hour news cycle the demand for information is constant and the quality of the data is a secondary consideration to the demand for headlines. We need to be cognizant of what can be achieved in our unique role as statisticians, as outlined in the UNFPOS, and communicated this to users and respondents. Not all data is created equally and the quality of our product and the principles that underpin that production should not eroded to meet perceived user demand. Of course we will continuously modernise and innovate to improve our products and speed of delivery but this cannot come at the cost of fundamental principles such as the confidentiality of our respondents and the independence of National Statistical Institutes.		30

By developing the new Statistics Act we hope that the government agencies envolved in NSS can understand and implement it fully and it will smooth the process of data transmission from government agencies. Moreover, by using the UNFPOS we can move to modenize the NSS and implement register- based census instead of traditional ones.	1- Providing technical advices, consultaion and assistance 2- Organizing training workshps/courses.	180

In its preparation Istat is assisted by the User Council and is supported by several advisory groups (called â€œquality groupsâ€), one for each topic included in the program. The groups are permanent bodies, made up of producers and users of official statistics representing public and private actors belonging or not to NSS (e.g. bank and credit system, academic world, trade unions). After decision by Comstat, the NSP is submitted for opinion to the Commission for the Protection of Statistical Information, the Unified Conference State-Regions and the Data Protection Supervisor and later for deliberation to the Inter-ministerial Committee for Economic Planning. It is finally issued with a Decree by the President of the Republic.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0		For information on release calendar please refer to: https://www.istat.it/en/analysis-and-products/press-releases The press release for 2018 is available in Italian at https://www.istat.it/it/files//2013/12/calendario_2018.pdf	4-12 months		1	--	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	None	No		0	1	0	1	0		0	0	0	0	1	Anonymised microdata cannot be redistributed	0	0	0	1	1	for statistical purposes only; indicating that the responsibility for analysis and processing is not to be attributed to Istat		Yes	1	1	0			Yes	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0		Yes	----	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	Peer reviews on the European statistics Code of Practice	1	1	1	0	0	0	0		1	1	1	1	0	0		1	1	0	0	0		Through participation in courses at both national level and international level.

In the coming years, Mexico needs to bolster statistical culture among public institutions and scientific standards for its development.	Technology is changing the way we consume information and how data is produced and stored. This will bring new risks and challenges related to legislation, confidentiality and information misuse. In this sense, the implementation of UNFPOS will need to consider susch risks and renew its orientation towards a more inclusive and dynamic approach. In Mexico, this calls for a deeper discussion on legislative initiatives, institutional capacities, and more coordination between domestic and international players.	International organizations promote more cooperation and discussions in regards to standards, scientific principles, transparency, and ethics. They represent key opportunities for countries to communicate between each other and share their experiences and best practices to improve data quality.	120

This approach has been embedded into our project management procedures (Prince2) to ensure that a project will create and verify products that are fit for purpose. This includes the methods used to accept the products, and who is responsible (quality planning); then ensuring that the quality methods are implemented and tracked (quality control and assurance). There are three stages in the Stats NZ quality management system: 1. Assessing quality and risk in the end to end process 2. Establishing routine management tasks 3. Review and evaluate for the system continuous improvement. Much of the statistical quality assurance work is undertaken by Stats NZ statistical methodology unit and they have recently adopted â€˜ASPIRE' to assess quality of official statistics especially when new and alternative data sources are used as input. ASPIRE is an evaluation process that gives rise to a set of numerical indicators that over time signify a changing level of quality risk for a statistical product.

No			Yes	Open Data NZ	Stats NZ has responsibility for the NZ Open Government Data Programme which supports all government agencies to open their data. The Open Data Action plan is the mechanism for coordinating and reporting on activities to achieve the outcomes.	Over the past ten years that UNFPOS has underpinned and guided Stats NZ's statistical programme and work across the Official Statistics System. We are now reviewing our legislation and so will look to the UNFPOS for guidance in our work.	The key challenge is applying the principles in an ever-changing environment where data is everywhere and technological change is rapid. Our customers and stakeholders have high expectations about what we should deliver and views on how to ensure that we are delivering value and are maintaining relevance. Ensuring that the value of the principles are understood is not always straightforward.	New Zealand is reviewing the Statistics Act 1975 which will shape our work as an NSO over the next ten years or so. Even though our current legislation predates the UNFPOS, there is a high degree of consistency. We expect that the UNFPOS will pay a role in shaping our new Data and Statistics legislation.	Given the 'age' of the current principles, it would be good for international organisations to help facilitate a conversation about what would trigger reviewing the principles and/or when we would consider undertaking one. There are risks and challenges in reviewing them but given the rapid pace of change, there is also a risk to monitor and mitigate of them becoming becoming less relevant and more difficult to adhere to in practice.	240

Yes	Open Data Watch (ODW), The Open Data Committee which formed by the Palestinian Cabinet.		* The professional independence of PCBS is not explicitly stated in the General Statistics Law (GSL). However, a decree that has been issued by the Council of Ministers stressed the importance of the professional independence of PCBS to enhance the credibility of statistical figures and to strengthen the confidence of individuals and institutions in statistics. In addition, the Council of Ministers approved the adoption of the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. * PCBS implemented the European Code of Practice in 2010 and implemented the Code of Practice for the European Neighbourhood of South Countries based on 16 Principles covering three main issues: Institutional Environment, Statistical Processes, and Statistical Output. * PCBS started its work to establish the NQAF during 2012, to enhance the Quality for all statistics, in order to achieve the Quality policy and Objectives. In 2016, PCBS finished preparation of the guidelines for the Palestinian NQAF. * In 2017, PCBS finished the NQAF for the National Statistical System, which is supposed to be the reference for all components of the national statistical system, where it was prepared to ensure the quality of the official statistical figure.	The main challenges in implementing the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (FPOS), where the basic principles are related mainly to: Lack of effective human resources system of the partners' statistical units, ongoing internal change of the statistical units staff, weakness of the statistical capabilities of statisticians in the statistical units, weakness of the accumulation and exchange of experience among the partners' staff and this is due to turnover and new appointments, no commitment in using the approved concepts and terminology, as well as the differences in the use of classifications by partners' statistical units. Challenges that have to do with the ability to embed FPOS in the statistical law in explicit manner. Changes to statistical law that need to undergo very lengthy process. Experience has shown that the practice on the ground is what really matters when it comes to exercising FPOS regardless of the type (explicit or implicit reference to FPOS) or strengths of related legislations. Despite the existence of the law that there is still ineffective to force institutions to reach the official statistical number using all the classifications, concepts and terminology used at PCBS and ensure their unification. The ineffectiveness of the law to force the data-producing institutions to provide it to PCBS Absence of a law that guarantees accessing information by PCBS	Spreading the culture of quality of figures in the Palestinian research Implementation of the standard methods at the Palestinian institutions	The programs of international institutions can include training and awareness programs for all partner institutions within each country in order to ensure training them on the principles of statistical work and how to ensure that all institutions, which produce statistical numbers, abide by those principles.

The derived topics not included in the regulation were omitted mainly due to: lack of interest in data by domestic users (ex. Bedrooms-number of, Lighting and / or electricity-type of), lack of comparability with the Census round 2001. Simultaneously, Poland participated in works on Recommendations for the 2010 and 2020 Censuses of Population and Housing managed by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

The service is used by international institutions, eg UN, OECD and EUROSTAT.		In the census and in integrated farm statistics, the international standards defined by Eurostat are fully used.In statistical research Statistics Poland applies international classifications and nomenclatures what makes comparing statistical data possible.In order to facilitate international comparisons of statistics in the field of tourism, as well as to achieve efficiency and quality in the data production, international statistical standards are being used. We follow the international recommendation (EU, UNWTO, OECD) in the scope of concepts, definitions, classifications. In order to fulfil the requirements we follow the instructions in the Methodological manual for tourism statistics and also the NACE classification. On the other hand UNWTO elaborated the International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008 (also known as IRTS 2008) provides a comprehensive methodological framework for collection and compilationof tourism statistics, that we follow.In order to facilitate international comparisons of statistics in the field of health care expenditure international statistical standard SHA2011 (System of Health Accounts 2011) is used. The National Health Account is a set of tables containing health care expenditure according to the international ICHA classification (International Classification for Health Accounts) developed in accordance with the common methodology of the OECD, Eurostat and WHO.Statistics Poland is working on environmental economic accounts in order to fulfil legal requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 of European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2011 on European environmental economic accounts and Regulation (EU) No 538/2014 of 16 April 2014 of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 691/2011. Currently questionnaires on six environmental accounts (Economy â€“ Wide Material Flow Accounts, Air Emissions Accounts, Environmentally Related Taxes by Economic Activity, Environmental Goods and Services Sector Accounts, Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts, Physical Energy Flow Accounts) are transmitted annually to Eurostat.	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	More than 300 business trips are organized each year (and the number is increasing- 386 in 2017). Moreover, Statistics Poland hosts incoming delegations (around 30 a year). We have not yet entered yet into twinning projects. Visits within TAIEX as well as bilateral cooperation within Polish Aid programme were undertaken.	0	The Polish official statistics operates within statistical systems of international organizations, that Poland is a member of: the statistical system of the UN and its regional commission (UNECE), the ESS functioning within the European Union as well as the statistical system of the OECD.The cooperation with international organizations covers not only fulfilment of Statistics Poland commitment to provide regularly statistical data to the databases of international organizations,but also involvement in analysis and surveys conducted by those organizations and participating in works regarding improvement of quality of statistics as well as ensuring international data comparability.The international cooperation is in many cases the driving force of innovation, standardisation and a reason for producing new statistics. It also has a positive effect on the quality of published statistics due to peer reviews and quality control by / reports to international organisations.It should be noted that the involvement of Statistics Poland in actions undertaken in the international fora, and active participation in the law-making process, elaboration of indicators definitions and classifications, guarantees the influence on their shape and facilitates their quick and easy implementation in the Polish statistical regime. In a broader context it leads to ensuring that the Polish official statistics provide the high-quality and internationally comparable statistical information.	N/A			Yes	UN - Friends of the Chair - Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (FoC-FPOS) & Eurostat â€“ DIGICOM Project in the scope of Linked Open Data	Statistics Poland strongly agrees that bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. In the 2015 peer review report on cooperation / level of integration within the ESS, it was found that Poland: â€œparticipates actively in the European statistical cooperation and is fully integrated in the European Statistical Systemâ€. The same applies to other international statistical systems in our assessment. Statistics Poland does not receive support from donors, however we receive support via Eurostat grants procedure (as other EU MS) which facilitate the development of the new concepts/surveuys. In recent years the tendency can be observed to get involved in an increasing number of grant projects every year.	Over the past 10 years, one of the most important milestones was the implementation of European Statistics Code of Practice since 2005. Its principles are consistent with the ones of the FPOS.All NSO actions have been in line with the UNFPOS. The UNFPOS principles have been reflected in the statistical law as well as in the fundamental standards of conducting statistical work, i.e.data confidentiality, burden reduction. For example implementation of the eDAMIS system for secure and timely transmission of the data, including confidential data. Moreover, the use of administrative data sources has increased significantly.The amount and scope of international cooperation activities (also at the top Management level) of Statistics Poland has risen and widen in recent years. Number of business trips and expertsgoing abroad has also increased. The milestone that should not be underestimated, also in the international fora, is the new visual identification (English name, logo and information portal,social media in English). The international recognisability of our Office improved in our opinion. Statistics Poland President was elected as a member of high-level bodies within the EU.This trend is being continued.	The main challenges will concern:- the principle 8 on coordination role of the NSI to make it work smoothly and mutually beneficial,- meeting the fundamental statistical principles by monitoring each misuse of official statistics as well as its missinterpretation,- actions related to open data and its dissemination,- acquiring personal data from administrative registers,- systematic development of IT systems enabling the implementation of international recommendations to ensure secure data transfer.	Not much change is foreseen as a level of implementation is assessed as high. As the EU member country we tend to focus our activities on the European quality standard that is: European Statistics Code of Practice - which reflects UNFPOS, but provides form more detailed quality framewok. The implementation of the CoP is monitored by a regular peer reviews \reports, recommendations and improvement actions. Those are publicly available.With time, all procedures following each principle will be improved and developed on the base of gained experiences and shared-knowledge. All processes (including updating ones) will run smoothly without bigger interferences.It is planned to increase the use of administrative data and recognizing the possibility for implementing the Big Data as a data source for official statistic.NSO is constantly working on increasing the quality of data, we are improving methods of data presentation so the implementation of rules is supposed to constantly increase.	It should be clearly communicated and agreed on the international level if the adherence to another (more specific) standard such as European Statistics Code of Practice is to be perceived as an implementation of the UNFPOS. This was already established in regards to relation between OECD Council Recommendation on Good Statistical Practice and the EU CoP.The international organizations should maintain thair commitment to national statistical institutesfor cooperation as well as manage this cooperation in order to establish common and harmonized methodological recommendations for data production.International organizations could contribute to the implementation of UNFPOS by sharing good practices enhancing knowledge and experience exchange as well communicating/promoting principles to users. It could help with improving the quality of data.	0

Most importantly, we do not want the free access interest to ruin the current participation rate of the community in data collections when people and groups of people will be exposed through analysis.

It has improved the NSS over the years and also improve the status of the NSO	No		1. Our NSO has to compete with all other line ministries in getting funds to support our annual activities. This means every year we make funding proposals to government through the Cabinet Development Committee to endorse our proposal and it is the role of the Ministry of Finance to seek funds for our statistical activities if approved.It is the same for all other line ministries.2. We also have bilateral relationships with other donors that we can seek funding or technical opportunities if approved funding is not sufficient.	No		1. We appreciate support as long as there are no strings attached. We've had situations where donors want to achieve what they think it is best for the countries.2. We want all donors contributing to any statistical activity and mainly statistical surveys to other line ministries to ensure that other line ministries are obligated to the Fundamental Principles of OS so that survey results are statistically sound. We've had situations where donor do not care how the line ministry carry out their own data collection without adherence to the principles.	1. NSOs has gained a better reputation over the last 10 years by sticking to the UNFPOS2. NSOs has gained a lot of trust by users and international agencies through the use of the UNFPOS3. We've managed to publish our first NSDS 2011-2021 and intending to review it before it ends4. The NSO is highly respected to work with the national planning office and also to coordinate the SDG indicators for Samoa by the National SDG Taskforce5. We've managed to use new technologies such as tablets, scanners, new software with success but also with more challenges to come6. We've managed to work more collaboratively and share resources with other line ministries and also donor partners	1. Lack of capacity to sustain and promote the UNFPOS2. Lack of resources, time, etc3. Lack of training for line ministries and users	1. A lot of line ministries will eventually uphold the UNFPOs	1. Capacity building and training2.

They have a long tradition in the national statistics in Slovenia; they were established in the 1980s and were formally introduced in 1995 with the Decree on the Establishment of Statistical Advisory Committees on the basis of Article 15 of the National Statistics Act. Statistical advisory committees have a significant impact on the development of national statistics in Slovenia at expert level and in cooperation of institutions in common efforts to provide quality, timely and relevant statistics.

According to Article 25, the Annual Programme of Statistical Surveys is determined each year by the head of SURS in cooperation with other authorised producers of national statistics. The main elements on which the programme is based are the Medium-term Programme of Statistical Surveys, the European Statistical Programme, the Statistical Work Programme of the Commission, and consultations with national stakeholders through statistical advisory committees and other forms of consultations.At the end of the year the Management Board of SURS discusses and evaluates the progress in achieving the main objectives of national statistics determined by the medium-term programme. The conclusions of this discussion are the basis for the preparation of the annual report. The annual report presents the work performed by SURS and authorised producers according to the annual programme of statistical surveys. The draft is discussed by the statistical advisory committees and is then submitted to the Statistical Council.According to Article 18 of the NSA, SURS as a professionally independent government office, is directly involved in the phase of preparation and harmonization of the national budget.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0		Every November, SURS publishes a Release Calendar of announced publications for the following year. A publicly released Release Calendar for the current and previous years is easily accessible from SURS's website (https://www.stat.si/StatWeb/en/ReleaseCal). It covers all statistics defined in European regulations and agreements, and statistics covering national requirements and needs. The release calendar includes all releases, i.e. first releases, updates of the SI-STAT database and all other publications. The search engine allows browsing by title, producers, date, theme and sub-theme. Release Calendar also includes releases from authorized producers (NSS) with a link to the release on their website.	4-12 months		2	SURS and authorized producers (equal Slovenian NSS) do not need any approval to publish statistical information.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0				0	0	1	0	0		0	0	0	1	0		0	0	0	1	0		Answer to the question 1.7 as there was no possibility to enter it:SURS provides online access to all aggregates in accordance with the National Statistics Act and Annual Work Programme without without any conditions.

New statistical surveys or surveys which are subject to a major revision are discussed by the Methodological Council, which issues an opinion about the proposed changes. It is composed of ten members appointed by the SURS's Director-General. Three members are the employees of SURS and seven members are outside members â€“ experts from the field of statistical methodology from different scientific disciplines (in practice they are well known professors of statistics from the Universities). The Council is headed by the head of the Sector for Processes and Communication. The work of the Council is defined by the Instruction on the procedure for verification and approval of statistical surveys' methodology. Authorized producers are invited to participate at the sessions of the Council as observers, as well as to present their own statistical survey and benefit from the view of the experts.	1	1	0	0	0	0	0		1	0	1	0	0	0		1	1	1	0	0		Training and skills development at SURS comprises a broad range of activities, including formal and informal learning, job rotation, in-house and external training (course topics ranged from methodology and processes, statistical fields, dissemination and data visualisation, specific IT topics and the ESS system, to leadership and inter-personal skills), traineeships, integration of new employees (mentoring as a part of 'on the job' training), our EMOS involvement as well as international collaboration - our staff members participate in numerous ESTP training courses, conferences, seminars and workshops..Forming long-term partnerships and innovative ways of cooperation with external academic parties. With that in mind, SURS has successfully established mutual agreements on cooperation in education, research and consulting activities with various faculties in Slovenia, including the Faculty of Social Science, the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Organisational Sciences, and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science.It is particularly beneficial for a small statistical office like SURS to be involved in different international activities, such as working groups, initiatives, projects and task forces to obtain hands-on experience and exchange knowledge. This also provides colleagues possessing different expertise profiles with diverse learning experiences and opportunities for professional growth, which turns out to be a strong motivational factor. We actively encourage our staff members to participate in international consultations, working groups, task force meetings and committees.

The UNFPOS are taken into account as one of the basis for official statistics and consulted whenever necessary. SURS is as a member of European Statistical System closely following the principles of the European Statistical Code of Practice, which are in many cases well aligned with the UNFPOS. In last 10 years, the European Statistical System has twice undergone the system of the peer reviews â€“ a detailed review of the implementation of each European Code of Practice principles and this is what is indirectly raising also our compliance with UNFPOS and could be as such mentioned as an important milestone.	It is important to have the principles (whether UNFPOS or European Code of Practice) constantly present throughout the whole organization and not just when there are some specific review activities. Whenever some changes are introduced in the organization, the changes should be carefully studied also from perspective whether they increase or at least maintain the achieved level (regarding UNFPOS or European Code of Practice).	The presence of UNFPOS will remain approximately the same, but the implementation will increase (indirect effect of the development/implementation of the European Code of Practice).	No specific proposal at the moment.	1200

The report by the reviewers was very positive.- The outcomes of the last two general Users Surveys (2013 and 2016) shows an improvement of trust and credibility of NSO in Spain.- The Board of Directors agreement about using GSBPM as a processes standard (2014)	Major challenges for Statistical offices in Europe are: - The increasing problem of lack of resources.- Reluctance of respondents to cooperate due to an over charge of surveys both from public and from private institutions. - The need of a closer cooperation with the owners of Public administrative data. There is a need to improve the knowledge about the statistical possibilities of these sources. Metadata of those data input are necessary.- And the "Big data" challenge: how to balance the possibilities of these data as a new source with the question of the privacy of data; how to balance the role of private companies as holders/ creators of these data with the role of National Offices as a main actor/ provider/ which can guarantees quality in statistics.			50

The results of the studies are permitted to be taken outside the Institute after the completion of controlling processes by the related experts of Turkstat. The second facility to allow user microdata is distribution on cd-rom or any other device for the Group B microdata, data in which individual data is hidden, and has no restriction for dissemination. In context of relevance, in Turkstat, procedures are in place to consult users about the statistical needs which the tools are User Evaluation Report and User Survey. User Evaluation Report Dissemination policy of the institution is to meet user requests for timely and quality, to improve awareness of using statistics. Aims for the future targets of the institution is to meet national needs for data produced as well as ensuring compliance with international standards and methodologies. Therefore, after the reference year, â€œUser Evaluation Reportâ€œ is being prepared for determining expectations, needs and the profile of the users and to have decision about production and dissemination policies by analyzing information requests. In the process of replying information requests, all requests are recorded by "Dissemination Management Systemâ€ in detail. Information requests received by Regional Offices are also obtained and recorded as to provide data integrity. By using these data, helping to guide the activities of production and distribution policies of the institution, to lead managers to plan and program and inform for deciding targets, User Evaluation Report is published for internal use. User Survey TurkStat has a user survey on its website for determining profiles, needs and expectations of users and setting the policies of the Institution in the medium and long term. It is analyzed annually and the report of the survey is shared with the staff via intranet. Structure and questions of the survey were changed in 2013 and questions appear under four main parts which are general information, using status of TurkStat data, perception and trust, and evaluation.

In this context, main means used for development of professional skills of staff at TurkStat are the courses, training programs, study visits, internship programs and consultancy activities mostly funded by EU. All training activities in TurkStat are planned and implemented through the Training Strategy with the aims to increase technical knowledge and working efficiency of the staff, as well as make them able to produce data/information in accordance with the international standards. Also, TurkStat provide special career path to the assistant experts. Expertise Area Training Program (EATP) is developed in order to increase technical knowledge and working efficiency of the assistant experts, as well as make them able to produce data/information in accordance with the international standards on the subjects of their expertise.

Accordingly, TurkStat implemented Time Use Survey (TUS) for the first time in 2006 in harmony with Harmonised European Time Use Survey (HETUS) 2002 Guideline. The second application was implemented on 1 August 2014 - 31 July 2015 by using HETUS 2008 Guideline as a reference document. TUS, 2014-2015 micro data and metadata file set was prepared and transferred by TurkStat to Eurostat HETUS Database 2010 for the first time. Consequently, activity coding list and location of activity coding list recommended in HETUS guideline were used as classification of activity in TurkStat. There are some differences between ICATUS and HETUS activity list. It can be understood that it's reason is for classifying the activities based on the concept of productive/non-productive activities following the System of National Accounts (SNA) framework in ICATUS 2016. It can be seen that the activities were grouped by taking reference of their aims and intentions in ICATUS 2016. This methodology seems logical and beneficial. In the future this subject will be more important, so more countries may use this activity list.	1	0	0	0	Partially, only in some statistical domains or data sets			Within the context of Official Statistics Programme, TurkStat has been studying and reporting on environmental accounts as listed below, which were covered in the EU Environmental Economics Accounts Regulations of 2011 and 2014. Material Flow Accounts since 2009 Air Emission Accounts since 2010 Environmental Taxes since 2013 Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts since 2015 Environmental Goods and Services Sector since 2015 Energy Accounts since 2017 (2015 reference year data) In this context Material Flow Accounts, Air Emission Accounts, Environmental Taxes have been reported to Eurostat and published as web statistic tables in TurkStat website annually. Furthermore, according to our national data release calendar, we will publish the press release related to Environmental Protection Expenditure Statistics on 27 November 2018. On the other hand, we continue to work on in order to develop the Environmental Goods and Services Sector and energy accounts.	1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	TurkStat has has benefited from EU based programmes and projects from 2003 on. Besides being the beneficiary side of such programmes, TurkStat has been supporting technical assistance programmes and international projects for long. Main target groups are such as Caucasian, Central Asian, Balkan, Middle East, Northern Africa, and Islamic countries and TurkStat's experience in international cooperation as donor institution dates back to early 1990's. Apart from these programmes, the experts of TurkStat have participated in many working groups of Eurostat, UN and UNECE. The participation in these groups contributed a lot to knowledge and experience of these experts and mediately their colleagues. Memberships in the Bureaus of CES (2013-2015) and Committee on Statistics and Statistical Policy (CSSP) 2015 were also interesting experiences both from the view of high level administration of TurkStat and experts.	Yes	Turkey's EU candidacy in 1999 was a breakpoint in TurkStat for capacity building efforts. Turkstat has benefited from EU Programmes (national and multi-beneficiary) a lot. Upgrading the Statistical System of Turkey (USST) Programmes Phases I-II-III (2003-2014) and IPA projects have contributed to TurkStat and its staff.		No			The more the statistical literacy and visibilty activities such as World Statistics Day increase, the more the consciousness about UNFPOS (and hence European Statistics Code of Practice) increases. In the last decade, the content and the importance of UNFPOS were underlined on many platforms such as meetings within the framework Official Statistics Programme.	In spite of efforts towards promoting UNFPOS, the lack of statistical literacy and consciousness slightly undermine these.	The better implementation of the UNFPOS will really contribute the prestige of both NSO and NSS. Furthermore, their implementation will further strengthen them legally.	International organizations should underline the importance and the main idea of UNFPOS, not to be restricted with statistical societies but also at other platforms coinciding with statistics. Moreover, celebration and visibility opportunities such as World Statistics Day might be increased.	120

The Authority reports directly to Parliament and is independent of ministerial control.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		Yes, always	Pre-release access to statistical outputs from the Office for National Statistics (the NSO) ceased in July 2017 at the instruction of the National Statistician, other than for exceptional circumstances. The overarching principle is that an exceptional circumstance is where someone would need to act or make a decision in the public interest on the basis of the statistics. Not granting pre-release in such a case runs the risk of decisions being made on the basis of out of date information. Pre-release access granted exceptionally by the NSO is always fully transparent and documented here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/prereleaseaccess . The only exemptions to date have been given to the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee and the Office for Budget Responsibility.For other government departments that produce official statistics, pre-release access is regulated through the Statistics and Registration Services Act 2007 and associated Pre-Release Access to Official Statistics Orders for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This feeds through into the Code of Practice for Statistics. Ministers of the Crown and their equivalents in devolved governments may grant pre-release access through these Orders. The length of access allowed by the Orders varies. In England it is 24 hours. In Scotland, it is 5 days.Departments must publish a current list of all those who have pre-release access to each statistical release.	0	0	1	0	1	Aggregated official statistics and publicly available anonymised microdata are available free of charge and without pre-registration.	1	1	0	0	0		1	1	0	0	1	Data are provided under the Open Government LIcense: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/		Yes	1	1	0			Yes	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0		No		1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0		1	0	1	1	1	0	0		1	1	1	1	0	0		1	0	1	0	0		The Government Statistician Group (GSG) is the civil service profession for statisticians, and is headed by the National Statistician.

N/A			Yes	UK Open Data Institute (ODI) https://theodi.org		Establishment of the UK Statistics Authority in 2008, underpinned by the Statistics and Registration Services Act 2007, and the implementation of independent regulation of official statistics through the Office for Statistics Regulation.Development of the Code of Practice for Statistics in 2009, underpinned by the Statistics and Registration Services Act 2007, and the launch of a refreshed version of the Code in 2018, and formal assessment of compliance with the Code.	The UK Statistics Authority only produces approximately 60% of the Official Statistics within the UK. The remaining statistics are produced by other government departments, other public bodies, and other public facing bodies that are prescribed by legislation. This partially devolved system makes it difficult to enforce the FPOS across all producers of Official Statistics. Many bodies are part of the Government Statistical System and through a strong professional group we are able to promote the FPOS. Furthermore the UK Statistical System has the Office for Statistical Regulation, this body can investigate breaches of the Code of Practice, but it is not possible for the body to proactively oversee all the official statistics being produced in the UK.	If implemented with good publicity the UNFPOS can help promote trust in official statistics. Also through having the UNFPOS as the foundation of many national systems can help the guardians of those systems when they are challenged by politicians, businesses and other influencers.	Through support for the National Systems, through pointing out when National Systems are meeting the FPOS and through naming the countries that have exemplar systems.	120

For example, when the Department of Commerce (DOC) receives budget for the FY, they decide how to allocate it amongst DOC agencies-- Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, NOAA, NIST, etc. Allocations are based on fiscal year projects that are indicated in the agency's strategic plan. During a decennial census, it would make sense that the Census Bureau budget increases substantially, then, drop after it is over.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0		An example:The Schedule of Release Dates for the Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEI) are published by the end of the prior fiscal year.

By mandate, the Office of the US Chief Statistician is responsible for coordinating the US Federal Statistical System.However, in practice, it is not ideal. There are many UN and OECD units that email directly to our agencies without our knowledge. We only hear about it when our agencies complain. Most offensively, is OECD's use of "blindcopy" emails... so much for transparency. Had they not done that, perhaps they would be informed earlier that they sent their budget programme surveys to the wrong POCs (March 2018 UNSC side event).	2008 SNA	The US National Accounts is produced by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.https://www.bea.gov/national/sna-and-nipas	Not implemented	Concepts are already in programs, so, this question is not applicable to US Population and Housing Censuses.	0	0	0	1	0	I do not have information to respond to this question by your survey deadline of November 30.	1	0	0	0	Partially, only in some statistical domains or data sets			RE: Question 9.4Although, US "Green GDP" was published in 1994, those statistics are not currently produced.	1	1	1	1	1	1	0		0	Participation in technical working groups with UN organizations and other countries has widen the perspective of many NSO managers. Most NSOs operate within limited resources to perform their agency mission; in many cases, this means meeting non-negotiable data/media releases on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, as well as researching improvement methodologies.In many cases, UN requests involve lengthy surveys and/or require special calculations. For example, when detail data at disaggregate levels are requested, I suspect ratios are applied to calculate the "splits"... which may or may not normally meet the quality standards of the agency's regularly-released data. Although, notations are made for transparency reasons, I do not think the UN entities pay that much attention to it.Increasing the understanding of where and why all the UN requests come from will lead to more cooperation.	N/A			Yes	GSA (https://www.DATA.gov)		We were very happy that the 49th UNSC marked the 10th year anniversary of SNA via a side event, inviting our own (retired) Dr. Brent Moulton, as one of the keynote guest speakers. Under his leadership, the US implemented many major SNA improvements, including capitalization of software and R&D.	With few exceptions (SEEA), the US has been able to implement UNFPOS.	I do not expect any radical UNFPOS implementation changes in the near future; very hard to predict for the next decade.	If the working group doesn't disband in the near future, membership should rotate to other countries. Continued collaboration (e.g. via workshops, working groups, etc.) will help immensely.	10
